As each new request needs to be evaluated for SOC2 and ISO processes, we have set up approvals for this process. When a team member requests a new tool to use, it first goes to our security team to approve and identify what type of access is needed. After that has been approved, the requester needs to add the payment information and it goes to the finance team to approve and complete. Previously, all these steps would have been done in direct messages on Slack, and there would not have been the required steps for our certifications process. Now, the requester can see exactly in which stage the request is and what next steps still need to be done to complete the request. I know exactly when I am needed to jump in, as I\u0026rsquo;m notified when it is time for me to approve my part of the Workflow.\u003c/span\u003e\u003cb\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\"\u003e\u003cspan\u003e4 - Automated database updates\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan\u003eExample: Workflows\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan\u003e \u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan\u003ecan be used to create an \u0026lsquo;item\u0026rsquo; in Qatalog, which is essentially a record of anything you want. We use Qatalog to manage all of our vendors, where we store key information about them, such as the renewal date, owners, cost, data risk, and more. At the end of the new vendor request Workflow (mentioned above), a new item is automatically created in the system, with much of the information already populated. It helps to eliminate a tedious manual task and ensures consistency of information. This was one example, but you can also use Workflows to automatically create other items based on the inputs, such as Clients, Projects, Campaigns, Cases, Products, Orders, or Bug Reports.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003cb\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003cspan\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://cdn.buttercms.com/NChIvUePRy2Tc5UwR3X8\" alt=\"undefined\"\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\"\u003e\u003cspan\u003e5 - Auto-assign tasks\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan\u003eExample: When you create a Workflow in Qatalog, you can specify tasks that need to be done by a particular person as part of the Workflow or as a result of it.

Despite this, they all have one thing in common; they are still trying to figure out remote work.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003eMore than two years after the entire industry started working from home, it\u0026rsquo;s still proving a challenge. That got me thinking. . . why is it so hard, and how do we get it right?\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003ch3\u003eToo many tools\u0026nbsp;\u003c/h3\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003eFirst, some context. The tech industry has evolved unbelievably fast in the past two decades. We\u0026rsquo;ve built new technology for almost everything and incorporated it into how we work. We\u0026rsquo;ve acquired deep, specialized knowledge, created new, better ways of doing things, and new teams and functions to do them. That should have supercharged our productivity, but it came at the expense of simplicity. Now, with all this new complexity, we\u0026rsquo;ve lost the shared context among teams, there are silos everywhere, and it\u0026rsquo;s become harder and harder to actually get work done.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003eLet\u0026rsquo;s look at a modern software company. There are typically more than 10 teams involved in the development process. Front-end developers, back-end developers, devops, reliability engineers, data scientists, growth engineers, designers, product managers, project managers, and that\u0026rsquo;s only product. If everyone isn\u0026rsquo;t aligned, it breaks.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003eYet alignment has become harder because each team has a different set of tools and a unique way of working. Engineering might document tasks in JIRA and follow agile methodology, while the Design team uses Asana, Figma, and a design thinking approach. Product Managers use another shiny new thing. Sales and support, another still. Everyone ends up working in their own little silos, speaking their own languages.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003eMeanwhile, work across teams still needs to be done. So, we fall back on one of the three things teams still have in common: Email, Slack, and Zoom.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003ch3\u003eThe unholy trinity\u003c/h3\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003eEmail, Slack, and Zoom have become the de-facto coordination layer within a company. We send hundreds of emails and spend hours on calls, just telling people what we\u0026rsquo;re doing, translating it from one tool\u0026rsquo;s language into another.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003eCompany announcement? Email. Project update? Zoom. Looking for a doc? Slack. Who\u0026rsquo;s working on what? The dreaded \u0026ldquo;@here.\u0026rdquo; It\u0026rsquo;s pure brute force. Scale this process up to 5,000 people and it falls apart completely.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003eBut it\u0026rsquo;s not realistic to expect Email, Slack, or Zoom to be the foundational coordination layer of your business. These tools don\u0026rsquo;t have enough structure. They weren\u0026rsquo;t built for it. We default to them because they\u0026rsquo;re the one thing everyone still has in common. A lot like a tourist grunting and gesticulating to get by in a foreign country where they don\u0026rsquo;t speak the language. But we can\u0026rsquo;t operate this way at scale.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003eCornell University\u0026rsquo;s Idea Lab partnered with Qatalog to investigate this idea.

Now, it\u0026rsquo;s wasting our time, driving us apart, and causing mistakes. It has failed. We\u0026rsquo;ve lost our shared context and we\u0026rsquo;re forced to operate at our company\u0026rsquo;s lowest common denominator: Slack, Email, and Zoom. We spend hours in these systems each week, translating our work from one language to another. It has become unsustainable. According to Asana\u0026rsquo;s Anatomy of Work Index, it now consumes over 60% of working time. That\u0026rsquo;s not just a problem, it\u0026rsquo;s a fatal flaw in the way we\u0026rsquo;re working today.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003ch3\u003eAnarchy or tyranny?\u003c/h3\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003eIn my experience, once companies identify the issue, they go down one of two paths:\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003e1) Total anarchy - \u0026ldquo;Let everyone use whatever tool, system, or methodology they want.

Next thing you know you regress to brute force processes.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003e2) Tyranny - \u0026ldquo;Everyone has to use the same tool stack and they have to operate in the same, standardized way.

Instead, 92% of respondents admitted to keeping one eye on their inboxes throughout the day, while 75% had the other on legacy Microsoft office applications.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003eThat\u0026rsquo;s how we learned client project planning was stuck in the past.

Within Qatalog, client projects are easily divided into phases, with visible \u003ca href=\"https://qatalog.com/goals/\"\u003eGoals\u003c/a\u003e tied to them.

With a shared Work Hub, these \u003ca href=\"https://qatalog.com/blog/post/too-many-meetings/\"\u003eroutine sync meetings\u003c/a\u003e can also be left in the past.

If your processes for this aren\u0026rsquo;t in place, neither your new joiners nor your new clients have a chance of getting off on the right foot.

In this post, we\u0026rsquo;ll look at why easy access to these resources isn\u0026rsquo;t a luxury\u0026mdash;it is a central element of efficient project management in today\u0026rsquo;s workplace.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003ch2\u003e\u003cb\u003eWhy too many project management tools hinder workplace collaboration\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003eProject management software was designed to make sharing information and tracking projects easier. Yet, the rapid growth of these services in the past decade can actually threaten how smoothly your team operates.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://learn.g2.com/saturation-saas-industry\"\u003eThere are now over 300\u003c/a\u003e SaaS tools in the project management space alone. Asana, Trello, JIRA, and Basecamp, to name just a few. And there are a whole bunch of connected tools, such as Google Drive, Notion, and GitHub. \u003ca href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbestechcouncil/2019/04/16/a-brief-history-of-it-management-how-saas-has-changed-everything/#542080f532dc\"\u003eAccording to Forbes\u003c/a\u003e, the average company is now using over 30 SaaS tools\u0026mdash;and often with some overlapping functionalities.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003eThe decentralisation of IT budgets is the main driver of this, with more than half of this budget now managed by individual teams in most organizations. While this gives them a greater freedom, teams are investing in their own tools and software for tracking projects\u0026mdash;without knowing what other teams are using.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003eAs a result, \u003ca href=\"https://qatalog.com/blog/post/productivity-tools-killing-productivity/\" rel=\"follow\"\u003ea fragmented work environment has emerged\u003c/a\u003e. Product leads can\u0026rsquo;t find the engineers\u0026rsquo; task lists and the growth team doesn't have easy visibility on the UX designer\u0026rsquo;s progress.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://cdn.buttercms.com/ck03EJc5S8GXrmKhkLqm\" alt=\"startae-team-7tXA8xwe4W4-unsplash.jpg\" /\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003ch3\u003e\u003cb\u003e1. Collaborating within a new work environment\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003eUnfortunately, cross-functional collaboration already has enough on its plate. Research in the\u003ca href=\"https://hbr.org/2015/06/75-of-cross-functional-teams-are-dysfunctional\"\u003e Harvard Business Review\u003c/a\u003e found that 75% of cross-department teams are already suffering, due to difficulties in communicating the roles, needs, and priorities of others.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003eAt the same time, cross-team collaboration is on the rise\u0026mdash;and remote work is adding to the complexity of relations between functions. In this environment, a fragmented workflow caused by competing tools and processes will become even more of a problem. And the need for a more holistic project tracking will become more important than ever.\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003ch3\u003e\u003cb\u003e2. Cluttered workflows disrupt productivity, focus, and efficiency\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003eThe diversity of project management tools isn\u0026rsquo;t simply an abstract problem. Rather, orienting yourself in a cluttered work environment is a genuine drain on energy and time. By using bandwidth keeping track of files, documents, and project links, you\u0026rsquo;re diverting attention from more productive work, interrupting focus, and disrupting flow.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003eAnd employees don\u0026rsquo;t always succeed, either:\u003ca href=\"https://warekennis.nl/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/bridging-the-information-worker-productivity-gap.pdf\"\u003e even back in 2012, when we didn\u0026rsquo;t have this many productivity apps and we were consuming less information in the workspace a survey found\u003c/a\u003e that two hours a week are lost per head in searching for digital documents that are never located.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003eAs a result, employee time is spent building their own landmarks on this terrain. They create expensive and tailor-made workarounds\u0026mdash;like bookmarks and links lists\u0026mdash;to locate documents across project tracking tools. But these navigation options aren\u0026rsquo;t always shareable, scalable, or even comprehensible to others. Within one context, they may make sense. But when project links are loose from that context, information soon becomes confusing.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003eThis problem becomes more significant as workforces shift to remote. When links can\u0026rsquo;t be found, it\u0026rsquo;s natural to ask someone. But message pings are disruptive, and according to our research, half of employees we spoke to think there\u0026rsquo;s too much noise in the team comms already.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003ch3\u003e\u003cb\u003e3. The costs of inefficient project management\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003eIt\u0026rsquo;s not just individuals that are impacted by this sort of inefficiency. Organizations \u003ci\u003eas a whole\u003c/i\u003e suffer from the friction in their project management structures and processes.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003eMore time and money gets wasted with every workaround that gets developed and with every band-aid that gets applied. Often, an organization will build their own infrastructure from scratch to link up different platforms and tools\u0026mdash;which means yet more energy (and budget) is distracted away from developing the products and features that are meant to build instead.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003eAnd these band-aid solutions tend to miss the deeper point: project links and other resources should be managed better from the start, with quick access to them built into a \u003ca href=\"https://qatalog.com/blog/post/what-is-a-digital-workspace/\" rel=\"follow\"\u003evirtual workspace that promotes transparency and collaboration\u003c/a\u003e between your teams.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003ch2\u003e\u003cb\u003eHow can organizations improve tracking of project links?\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003eThe future of work is remote. And, in this new paradigm, the organizations that thrive will be the ones that collaborate and communicate smoothly online. Quick access to shared resources can\u0026rsquo;t be a luxury.
