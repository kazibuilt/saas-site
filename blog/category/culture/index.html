It is typically defined as a system where workers complete tasks on their own schedule, without being expected to respond to all messages or emails immediately. And this flexibility in turn gives asynchronous workers the freedom to fit work around their lives. \u0026ldquo;People are considering the role of work in their lives.

But they are unwilling to extend that same flexibility to their staff because they don\u0026rsquo;t trust them.

You could have a team of working parents, early risers, and mid-day swimmers, all collaborating productively on the same project. Which is why the promise of it is so desirable.

Collect everything in a shared Project\u003c/h3\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003eCreating a central location for all your documentation, resources, updates, and tasks is invaluable in providing context to everyone involved. Everyone gets excited about the potential of an offsite, leading to a large number of questions and information that needs to be shared to help people prepare.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003eInclude information about the location, visa application deadlines, processes for booking flights, and directions to the venue. Other company-wide information like travel insurance policies and expense policies should also be interlinked. You currently might have this information housed in an intranet or an HR system \u0026ndash; Marta had everything easily accessible, in one place, through Qatalog\u0026rsquo;s Company pages. The aim is to get anything offsite-related under one roof and in the same work tool. This allowed Marta to not repeatedly answer the same questions, and more importantly give employees a single place to find information, get their questions answered, and provide feedback. Keeping the employees fully informed and part of the transparent process.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003ch3\u003e2.

A key benefit of Posts is that everyone involved in the Project gets notified, and Marta gets insight into who has read them through real-time read-receipts. The Post can always be found within the offsite Project itself, which acts as a single source of truth and prevents scrolling back through multiple different threads or seeing outdated decisions or announcements.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003ch3\u003e5.

To grow and develop in their role, feedback on work and structured performance reviews are key. The former is often solved by implementing HR tools that sit separately to day-to-day work and seldom get used, or people revert to unstructured impromptu feedback over Slack messages, destined to be forgotten. Feedback should be baked into the context of work and this is where Qatalog\u0026rsquo;s Kudos capability can help, allowing you to log feedback directly on a person's profile.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003eSharing and requesting feedback must be done in the right way to ensure it\u0026rsquo;s rich with context and gets the right visibility. For example, Threads within a Project or Team are a great way to get more sets of eyes on a decision or path you\u0026rsquo;d like to take. And comments on Posts or Pages can provide detailed feedback on an initiative you\u0026rsquo;re working on or a planning document you\u0026rsquo;re writing.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003ch2\u003eSo what improvements can you expect?\u003c/h2\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003eIntroducing the behavioral norms and values of open communication and visible decision-making is how you build a deliberate team culture. And a strong team culture creates a more inclusive and positive place for people to work.

One of the greatest challenges that remote team leaders face is the obstacle of creating a team culture and maintaining the \u0026lsquo;human element\u0026rsquo; of interaction. Remote companies need to be proactive about building team culture, it\u0026rsquo;s not something that will happen without intentional and broad effort.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003eMost agree it's important and needed, but many aren\u0026rsquo;t sure how to go about implementing it in a way that feels natural and effective. Offices create opportunities to connect naturally but they don\u0026rsquo;t often occur within a remote working environment, and an optional Friday virtual happy hour isn\u0026rsquo;t enough to foster a strong \u003ca href=\"https://runningremote.com/?utm_source=qatalog\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003eremote team culture\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003e. Remote culture is not simply about social bonding but touches upon all of the elements that create a strong culture, from values to trust.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003ch2\u003eChallenges of remote work team culture\u0026nbsp;\u003c/h2\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003eData suggests that remote workers suffer from a sense of isolation, so it is essential that opportunities are created for team members to connect, feel supported and be part of a vibrant team. Team culture is one of the core appeals that draws high-quality talent to organisations and creates an environment that promotes well-being as well as excellent work from employees.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003eThe challenges of building remote culture, are of course the lack of face-of-face communication, lack of belonging, as well as different time zones and cultures. Team rituals can be weaved into workdays and weeks, bringing people in distributed teams together in fun and innate ways. At the same time, rituals that maintain company culture go beyond just fun games, quizzes, and happy hours. They reinforce values that lay at the core of the company's unique DNA and make employees feel more authentic and appreciated.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003ch3\u003eHow rituals help remote teams\u0026nbsp;\u003c/h3\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003eRituals build team camaraderie and culture and create the \u0026ldquo;human element\u0026rdquo; that many remote workers long for. It\u0026rsquo;s helpful to remember, especially if working across various cultures, that a broad approach providing different forms of connection is beneficial as people need different things at different times to feel connected. Everyone has their preferred medium where they feel the most at home, and it\u0026rsquo;s important to take this into account.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003eRitual is a repetitive action built into our routine, something that we are used to and expect. That\u0026rsquo;s why it\u0026rsquo;s so powerful for maintaining social connections and enhancing psychological safety.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003eA muti-ritual approach tends to work best, with remote organisations confirming that facilitating multiple rituals engage many people in different ways, allowing them the opportunity to connect in ways that feel most natural to them.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003ch3\u003eRecommend rituals for creating remote team culture\u003c/h3\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCreating specific channels for certain topics\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003eA fun and easy way to start building remote team culture is to create specific \u0026lsquo;social-only\u0026rsquo; channels or threads in slack or your preferred communications tool. Ask team members to share a photo from their weekend, home office spaces, dinner or lunch ideas, or the books, podcasts or tv series they are currently engaging with.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003eSocial discussion threads and channels can be created for topics such as travel, parenting, food, articles to read, and more. Conversations tend to flow when a space has been created and someone starts the thread by contributing. Photos in particular are a great way to bring another element into the written online remote world, offering a glimpse into colleagues' lives, in and out of their remote work setting, helping people connect visually, which is often a missing link with remote teams.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAdd extra time for socialising before or after meetings\u0026nbsp;\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003eConnecting with colleagues is generally a highlight of the workday, and there can be a misconception that every minute of work time in a remote team needs to be productively work-output focused. In an office environment, there are times during the day for coffee and tea and casual conversations to talk, which doesn\u0026rsquo;t tend to happen in remote working environments.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003eAdding on extra time before or after meetings for casual conversations, in both 1:1 and team meetings, provides a clear opportunity to connect in an unstructured way that isn\u0026rsquo;t simply agenda related. It\u0026rsquo;s a simple and effective way to connect with colleagues which are likely to become a weekly highlight.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCo-working streaming sessions\u0026nbsp;\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003eCo-working sessions are an effortless way to allow for small-talk conversations while working in ways that colleagues would usually connect if in person, fostering a virtual team environment of joint working. Using your technology of choice, colleagues simply sign in, with or without video, and can tap in and out of conversion during the streaming session. It\u0026rsquo;s also an excellent way to allow for collaboration, brainstorming and discussing opportunities as teams work either individually or together on projects during streaming.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003eSome remote teams have a rolling ongoing streaming session people can join and leave throughout the day, and others set aside time blocks of 1 hour for smaller groups to connect. Playlists can be created and shared, creating a real-time connection that\u0026rsquo;s natural, effortless and high-energy.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eVirtual coffees and lunches\u0026nbsp;\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003eWhile Friday \u0026lsquo;happy hours\u0026rsquo; tend to be a common ritual among remote teams, virtual coffees and lunches can be overlooked. In office environments, coffees and lunches tend to be the most common way that colleagues connect on a personal level. Virtual coffees can be scheduled into the calendar every morning at the start of the work day. They allow for informal conversation as well as discussing any work-related questions or topics in an easy way, rather than sending emails, messages or scheduling calls.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003eRemote teams have found a weekly virtual team lunch to be a fun way to chat similar to in-person connections. Better yet, team leaders could order and have lunch delivered to colleagues for this weekly ritual.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eChallenges and quizzes\u0026nbsp;\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003ePeople enjoy different ways of connecting, and many are driven by challenges and quizzes to get competitive energy going. Quiz topics can be run similar to \u0026lsquo;pub\u0026rsquo; quizzes, with team members taking a turn creating a topic and questions and facilitating the online event live via video. There are also platforms that are created specifically for quizzes, which are both challenging and entertaining. Challenges are fun and easy ways to connect teams and can be broad, from fitness challenges to reading, meditating or cooking. A weekly or monthly challenge could be shared in Slack, with daily updates and check-ins from participants.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u0026lsquo;Ask a Boss\u0026rsquo; question sessions\u0026nbsp;\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003eRituals are not simply team building activities, as company culture is based upon values, involving people in the decision-making process, connection with the organisation, and building trust. While it\u0026rsquo;s important to create informal social opportunities to connect, it\u0026rsquo;s also equally pivotal to develop more formal ones that are directly \u0026lsquo;work related\u0026rsquo;. Allow for opportunities where team members can ask questions and share feedback, such as scheduled meetings where people can speak directly with leadership and \u0026lsquo;Ask a Boss\u0026rsquo; anything that\u0026rsquo;s important to them and the workplace.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCharity work together\u0026nbsp;\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003eReinforce company values by providing social responsibility initiatives, such as charity work or sustainability challenges. Colleagues can pick a social cause to contribute to, and fundraise together, with running challenges, morning-tea fundraisers with friends, or online crowd-funding. Locally, employees could be offered a day to volunteer with a local organization, providing an in-person connection opportunity, and sharing photos and their experiences back with the team.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eExperiment and create rituals that work for you\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003eThe core takeaway from team leaders is that the connection element is hugely important, but it must be intentionally created. Remote organisations that have had the most success have cultivated various rituals for different personality types. Rituals tend to work best with both mandatory and optional sessions and balance both informal and formal connections.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003eMany colleagues will have their own great ideas for connection and are often open and willing to be involved in creating a connection as much as leadership is. Ask for your team's input with a brainstorming session or a simple open question, and see what rituals excite and inspire others. With intention and experimentation, remote organizations will find their unique groove, and a vibrant culture can be created.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eLearn more\u0026nbsp;\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003eIf you are interested in learning more practices that will reinforce your company\u0026rsquo;s remote or hybrid work culture, join the world\u0026rsquo;s largest remote work conference and community, Running Remote.

If you can handle the balance of sync and async working like we do, you can really stay in your zone and get aligned with the rest of the organization at the same time.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eDo you think hiring is different for remote first organisations and individuals?\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003eThe hiring process has definitely changed, as everyone has an online presence now. When used deliberately, this means\u0026nbsp; someone can clearly tell who you are, what you are doing, and where you are heading, without speaking a word. For example, one of our talented engineers, Tobias, made a flexible icon family called \u003c/span\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://phosphoricons.com/\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003ePhosphor\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003e for interfaces, diagrams, presentations. It clearly showed that he really cared about design and those are the type of people you want to hire. That\u0026rsquo;s why it can be a really powerful tool for both companies and individuals to inform their decision making process. The rest is just looking for overlap in the intentions.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003eAs for onboarding, automating processes is always a great idea and I'm a huge fan of Qatalog\u0026rsquo;s workflows feature that helps people onboard themselves and keep track of progress.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eIn your experience, what are some of the challenges of remote work?\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003eMaking async work actually work! This requires letting individuals or teams work at their own pace, towards their own goals, with their own tools, but without creating\u0026nbsp; silos of information. At Qatalog, we are working to solve exactly this problem by building a work hub that powers transparency across work streams and helps people easily navigate the virtual workspace. When you have all three, it's bliss, but it does require conscious thought to get it right.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003eWe actually partnered with Cornell University to explore the challenges with remote work. We discovered that the uncontrolled adoption of digital tools is killing productivity in a remote setting, with employees wasting an hour every day trying to find information hidden within apps, 6 in 10 of people say it\u0026rsquo;s hard to know what colleagues are doing, and 43% say they spend too much time switching between different work apps like Slack and Zoom. You can find out more about this at language.work.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eLots more people in Turkey are now working remotely for global companies. What\u0026rsquo;s your take on this trend?\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003eIt's been great to see this transformation and I think the talent pool in Turkey has now overcome the initial barriers of old stereotypes and issues around trust. When I first started working remotely seven years ago, maybe 1 in 10 people that work in tech were working remotely for global companies. But now it's more like 7 or 8. It's a big beautiful world and there are an infinite number of opportunities and problems to solve.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003eOf course, there are also certain financial benefits that come with remote work, because of the ever-changing landscape of the Turkish economy and the exchange rate. But I am very positive about the shift to remote work. I firmly believe the know-how gained by individuals working for global companies/startups and the competition for talent it creates will have huge benefits for Turkey in the long run. Local employers are now competing with world's best companies for local talent, which forces them to come up with better offers/perks or to change their mindset to provide something as good.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003eWork is changing for the better, and this change has been created by competition, rather than simply waiting for it to happen.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003cb\u003eWhat\u0026rsquo;d be your advice to candidates who are applying to work in a global company?\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003eWe\u0026rsquo;ve been growing quickly since I joined, which means I get to do lots of interviews.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003eThis probably applies to most roles, but the best advice I can give to candidates is to clearly articulate what motivates you, the work you\u0026rsquo;re most proud of, and what you want to do next. It\u0026rsquo;s a simple but very powerful tool and will typically give the person hiring you most of what they need to make a decision. If there is an overlap between your intentions and the company\u0026rsquo;s, it\u0026rsquo;s pretty likely that you\u0026rsquo;ll get an offer.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003eFor global companies operating remotely, it\u0026rsquo;s also really important to look beyond your own environment and pay attention to what\u0026rsquo;s happening elsewhere in the world. At Qatalog, for example, we have 15 different nationalities, speaking 25 languages, working across eight countries. I\u0026rsquo;ve found it is often much easier to quickly build connections with team members when you have a sense of the different issues they might be thinking about. You don\u0026rsquo;t have to be an expert, clearly, but showing an interest can make all the difference.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eWhat do you think are the opportunities in design globally?\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003eDesign has become a huge industry of its own, with many different subcategories that fall under the \u0026lsquo;design\u0026rsquo;. This includes visual, product, UX, motion, and design systems, to name a few. Each of these goes deep and has lots of different opportunities within it. In my view, the biggest opportunity is solving business problems by making the end-user\u0026rsquo;s life easier, no matter how you do it, because that instantly creates competitive advantage and amplifies the value you can deliver.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003eThat\u0026rsquo;s why design is now recognised as being critical to the success of all sorts of businesses, with more companies investing in and building better design teams and adopting a \u0026ldquo;design driven\u0026rdquo; approach. Clearly, not everyone has the resources for professional design as we know it. In those instances, a no-code-like approach that empowers individuals or organisations to exercise \u0026ldquo;good design\u0026rdquo; on a fundamental level might be a good solution.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e","summary":"Design Lead, Ekrem Elmas, talks about why he joined Qatalog, working in a distributed team, and why design offers so many opportunities.","seo_title":"Meet Ekrem Elmas, our Design Lead","meta_description":"This interview first appeared on Webrazzi, the the leading Turkish technology publication.
