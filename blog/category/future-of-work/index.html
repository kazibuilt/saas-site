But for the foreseeable future, there will be plenty of situations where there is simply no replacement for the deep emotional intelligence that humans are able to provide, largely because we are able to draw on our own lived experience, which AI systems can never have. This allows us to be more empathetic, more flexible, and better able to deal with specific, nuanced needs.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd so, in a world where AI becomes ubiquitous, those with very high emotional intelligence will become even more valuable.

If AI tools can provide the necessary information and analyze patterns, it\u0026rsquo;s down to humans to consider whether there might be any potential blind spots. Is AI using a limited data set?

Again, the process for doing this is very labor intensive, with a huge number of (often highly skilled) people required to make this happen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe reason large language models (LLMs) are so transformative is because they enable information to be manipulated, analyzed and processed far more efficiently and accurately at a much greater scale than humans can ever be capable of. But a clear consequence of this is that many roles will inevitably be eliminated.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLet\u0026rsquo;s take a corporate law firm as an example.

Fairly soon, you\u0026rsquo;ll only need a Partner who assigns these tasks to autonomous AI agents that are powered by a specialized LLM. The assembly line has become almost entirely automated, overseen by a fraction of the initial workforce.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOf course, the inputs here are critical, as it\u0026rsquo;s likely the Partner will require some original thought and a clear idea of how they want to approach the transaction in the first place, which will guide the specific instructions provided to the AI agents. They will also be responsible for reviewing the outputs from the AI, and determining the next course of action. This demonstrates the potential inequity created by AI, where some roles will become much more valuable, while others disappear entirely.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThis is possible today\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis is not something we need to start worrying about in a few years. It\u0026rsquo;s already possible today. I know this because I\u0026rsquo;ve spent the last 18 months up close to this technology, building products and systems that leverage LLMs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs an example, we now have a system at Qatalog that uses our own AI models to automate our marketing and onboarding flow. First, it programmatically generates customized and highly targeted online adverts, including text and images. That ad takes you to a brand new AI generated landing page, which shows you what Qatalog\u0026rsquo;s custom software platform would look like for your business, because our AI model \u0026lsquo;understands\u0026rsquo; our product and how it can be used by different industries. Then, if you want to use that custom product, it\u0026rsquo;s built and ready to use almost instantly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eRapid progress\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat\u0026rsquo;s even more remarkable is that we are just at the beginning of this shift, but the speed of progress when it comes to LLMs means change will happen fast. Whether it\u0026rsquo;s from an academic paper or an open-source model, there is a major breakthrough almost every week that allows us to train models faster, cheaper, or with less compute power, often by orders of magnitude.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis is not normal. You might think we have suddenly cracked the code to problem solving and innovation. But the technology itself is the reason. Researchers and academics have been using LLMs to solve complex problems and trawl through existing literature at lightning speed for new connections and potential answers. Each time LLMs improve, our ability to create better LLMs does too. But this is also an early indication of how this technology will drastically expand the scale and scope of what humans can achieve, and we\u0026rsquo;ll see this recursive and exponential pace of improvement will permeate every industry, sector and practice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eA false sense of security\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGiven what\u0026rsquo;s coming, you\u0026rsquo;d think we\u0026rsquo;d be worried. But we've been lulled into a false sense of security.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eQatalog surveyed 2,600 knowledge workers in the US and UK to understand their perception of AI. The first half were surveyed in early November 2022 (shortly before the launch of ChatGPT), and then again in April 2023. The results reveal that knowledge workers are more confident AI can help them work faster, but have less confidence in an AI\u0026rsquo;s ability to fully automate parts of their role, while the perceived threat level from AI has actually \u003cem\u003ereduced\u003c/em\u003e.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo, what\u0026rsquo;s going on? The dominance of ChatGPT (and similar tools) in public discourse has fooled people into thinking there\u0026rsquo;s nothing to worry about, because ChatGPT is highly prone to hallucinations and, for lots of people, it feels more like a fun tool to play with.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn reality, the AI models we have today are phenomenally powerful and, with the right scaffolding and domain focused training, are already capable of large scale automation, as in the example from Qatalog above.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://language.work/research/ai-workforce/?utm_medium=blog\u0026amp;utm_source=blog\u0026amp;utm_campaign=ai-workforce\u0026amp;utm_content=tariq-blog\" rel=\"follow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eSee full data set here\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eA pandemic style response\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou might argue this lends credence to the\u0026nbsp;\u003ca href=\"https://futureoflife.org/open-letter/pause-giant-ai-experiments/\" rel=\"follow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ecalls from prominent figures to pause AI development\u003c/a\u003e, but that ship has sailed.

Thanks for talking to us today. Can you tell us a bit about your research with MIT?\u003c/h3\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eIn my current role at MIT, I study innovation, looking at why it happens, where it happens, and why it doesn\u0026rsquo;t happen everywhere. The goal is to understand how we can achieve more innovation, whether that\u0026rsquo;s for companies, communities, or countries. \u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003ch3\u003e\u003cspan\u003eAnd what actually is innovation? \u003c/span\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eIt\u0026rsquo;s such an overused word, and there\u0026rsquo;s a risk it becomes a bit of a buzzword, but it\u0026rsquo;s a very real phenomenon. At MIT, after much discussion, we settled on quite a simple definition. We describe innovation as the \u0026ldquo;process of taking ideas from inception to impact.\u0026rdquo; \u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eThe \u0026ldquo;process\u0026rdquo; definition is important because it highlights the fact innovation is not a single moment or a single person having a bright idea and that being enough. The reference to impact emphasizes the importance of having an actual impact in the world, which might not just be profit. And then in the middle of the definition, there\u0026rsquo;s this concept of an idea. \u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan\u003eThe MIT definition of an idea is a hypothetical match between a problem and a solution. And the better the match between the problem and the solution, the better the idea. \u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003ch3\u003e\u003cspan\u003eWhat are the typical ingredients you need within an organization to be innovative? \u003c/span\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eThere are lots of ingredients that take an organization from \u0026ldquo;business as usual\u0026rdquo; to becoming innovative, but I like to focus on two that I think are most important. \u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eFirst, there\u0026rsquo;s the design of the company. This is the internal \u0026ldquo;system\u0026rdquo; within an organization, which either facilitates or does not facilitate innovation. Is the organization optimized and measured just for business as usual or is space made to explore innovative ideas? Is it dominated by legacy IT or are there platforms for innovating? \u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eSecondly, it\u0026rsquo;s the people. This is partly a question of mindset, but also the incentives and culture within the organization. For example, an individual can have an innovation-oriented mindset, but if the culture and underlying incentives - such as KPIs, OKRs, and commissions - don\u0026rsquo;t favor innovation, it can be very difficult.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://cdn.buttercms.com/ZEHn0UzwTTuHQ9h9mZ1W\" alt=\"undefined\" width=\"661\" height=\"446\" /\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003ch3\u003e\u003cspan\u003eGiven this, what are the common barriers to innovation? \u003c/span\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eAs you\u0026rsquo;d expect, the common barriers flow from these two dimensions: the system and the people. For example, the CEO might be calling for innovation, but unless they architect the system and incentives in a way that is conducive to innovation, then it won\u0026rsquo;t happen, even if the frontline employees rally to meet this demand. \u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eParticularly if you\u0026rsquo;re trying to implement transformative innovation, you need to give people the space, permission, and scope to go beyond business as usual. Middle management also needs to be incentivized to enable innovation in their teams. Finally, it\u0026rsquo;s critical staff have the \u003ca href=\"https://qatalog.com/blog/post/barriers-to-collaboration/\" rel=\"follow\"\u003etools for collaboration\u003c/a\u003e and information sharing, which can often be more difficult for businesses burdened with legacy IT systems. \u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003ch3\u003e\u003cspan\u003eHow does this change for small organizations as compared to large ones? Or perhaps high growth organizations?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003e Organizations by their very nature are organized to achieve a purpose. Large organizations have special challenges because they usually consist of various business units and layers which oversee them, which all add up to a rather large bureaucracy. This results in a system which is not architected to enable innovation because frontline staff are often separated from each other in business silos and middle management may be incentivized just to optimize the legacy organization\u0026rsquo;s business as usual, rather than innovate even modestly. \u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eTypically, that\u0026rsquo;s why smaller organizations tend to be better at innovation because they don\u0026rsquo;t have the bureaucracy. But they\u0026rsquo;re not immune either, as you\u0026rsquo;ll often find legacy family-run businesses struggle too. Ultimately, it tends to be new businesses who are most innovative and good at achieving high growth. \u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eFor large organizations and more traditional small ones, an effective way of counteracting this can be to create an entirely separate business unit that is explicitly focused on being less bureaucratic and taking things forward. This makes it easier to introduce new systems for sharing information and collaboration, for example, without worrying about the legacy IT systems. You can implement new incentive structures and make sure the culture is aligned with the goals of innovation. \u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003ch3\u003e\u003cspan\u003eHave digital technologies changed our ability to innovate?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003e Undoubtedly, yes. Because they create a new framework for humans to communicate and interact. But they\u0026rsquo;re not a magic wand that makes everything better. \u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eIf we take a very simple example, like the introduction of email. On the one hand, it made it much \u003ca href=\"https://qatalog.com/blog/post/how-technology-transformed-our-perception-of-time/\" rel=\"follow\"\u003eeasier for people to communicate\u003c/a\u003e and share ideas with much less friction, all across the globe. But there were also inadvertent consequences, like the rise of spam, which distracted us and slowed us down, and phishing emails, which facilitated crime. Then you got another round of email innovation, which mostly solved these problems.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003e And I think we\u0026rsquo;ve seen a similar dynamic play out with newer technologies in the workplace today. They have made it even easier to collaborate in some ways - but the instant nature of them can, with notifications on our phone, can make people \u003ca href=\"https://language.work/research/killing-time-at-work/\" rel=\"follow\"\u003efeel as if they always have to be online\u003c/a\u003e. And there are now so many \u003ca href=\"https://qatalog.com/blog/post/productivity-tools-killing-productivity/\" rel=\"follow\"\u003edifferent apps\u003c/a\u003e that the volume of information can often be overwhelming, with information now inadvertently harder to find.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003e That\u0026rsquo;s why it\u0026rsquo;s critical that we take more of a systemic approach and think about how we can use digital technologies to create an integrated experience. \u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003ch3\u003e\u003cspan\u003eWhat\u0026rsquo;s your view on the value of \u0026ldquo;watercooler moments\u0026rdquo; and their importance in innovation? Is there a digital equivalent? \u003c/span\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eSo called \u0026ldquo;watercooler moments\u0026rdquo; are serendipitous moments of interaction at work, whether by a watercooler, in a lift, or on the bus home from work. In my view, they\u0026rsquo;re brilliant for innovation, as they facilitate interactions that aren't transactional, where people share ideas and make new connections that might not otherwise have happened. \u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eHowever, there\u0026rsquo;s also a risk that we overstate their significance, as these interactions are often inaccessible to large swaths of an organization. Imagine you work in different regional offices, or even different areas in a large office complex. Those people would probably never have a watercooler moment with others, especially senior management. \u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eWhat\u0026rsquo;s interesting about digital technologies is that they can level the playing field and create systems to facilitate these interactions in a much more intentional way. Thinking through how you set this up in your organization and what sort of permissions you need to make possible are really important to make sure that it's more inclusive than the original in-person water cooler moments. \u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003ch3\u003eDoes access, visibility, and discoverability of knowledge and information affect an organization\u0026rsquo;s ability to innovate?\u003c/h3\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eThe answer here has to be a resounding yes. Innovation is not a single moment of inspiration, as we often hear. As I mentioned earlier, innovation is a process, and to move forward that process, \u003ca href=\"https://qatalog.com/blog/post/distributed-companies-need-centralized-knowledge/\" rel=\"follow\"\u003eyou need a way of sharing information\u003c/a\u003e, showing what\u0026rsquo;s happened in the past, who to engage with, and a system for documenting ideas. This is especially important within large or high growth organizations, where there is often an uneven distribution of information. This is where digital tools can be really important. \u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eBut there\u0026rsquo;s also lots of \u003ca href=\"https://qatalog.com/blog/post/what-is-knowledge-management/\" rel=\"follow\"\u003etacit knowledge\u003c/a\u003e, and this tends to be the kind of knowledge that\u0026rsquo;s not written down or captured by traditional information management systems but is still very important for innovation. That\u0026rsquo;s why it\u0026rsquo;s crucial the next generation of tools and technologies take a more holistic approach and capture a broader range of knowledge and information. \u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://qatalog.chilipiper.com/book/round-robin-queue?utm_medium=organic-social\u0026amp;utm_source=press\u0026amp;utm_campaign=blog\u0026amp;utm_content=13-1-sam\" rel=\"follow\"\u003eBook a demo\u003c/a\u003e to see how \u003ca href=\"https://qatalog.com?utm_medium=organic-social\u0026amp;utm_source=press\u0026amp;utm_campaign=blog\u0026amp;utm_content=13-1-sam\" rel=\"follow\"\u003eQatalog\u003c/a\u003e can supercharge innovation and make information visible across your organization, with a bespoke operating platform designed just for you.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e","summary":"How to enable innovation in a digital world - according to MIT’s Dr Philip Budden.","seo_title":"The ingredients of innovation","meta_description":"How to enable innovation in a digital world - according to MIT’s Dr Philip Budden.","featured_image_alt":"","url":"https://qatalog.com/blog/post/the-ingredients-of-innovation","featured_image":"https://cdn.buttercms.com/tm9XUmacSuGTUUUwFi1w","author":{"bio":"Sam Ferris leads on all things communications and helps to tell the story of Qatalog and its customers.","slug":"sam-ferris","email":"sam.ferris@qatalog.com","title":"Communications Manager @ Qatalog","last_name":"Ferris","first_name":"Sam","facebook_url":"","linkedin_url":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/sam-ferris-83a115113/","instagram_url":"","pinterest_url":"","profile_image":"https://cdn.buttercms.com/SsARjvkrSVS3B6V0sUrA","twitter_handle":"@_Sam_Ferris"},"tags":[{"name":"Software","slug":"software"},{"name":"Features","slug":"features"}],"categories":[{"name":"Future of work","slug":"future-of-work"}]},{"status":"published","created":"2022-12-13T17:57:42.091603Z","updated":"2022-12-15T15:47:35.690164Z","published":"2022-12-13T17:25:00Z","title":"How technology transformed our perception of time","slug":"how-technology-transformed-our-perception-of-time","body":"\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eWhen I was invited by \u003ca href=\"https://qatalog.com/pricing/?utm_medium=organic-social\u0026amp;utm_source=press\u0026amp;utm_campaign=blog\u0026amp;utm_content=cta-siobhan\" rel=\"follow\"\u003eQatalog\u003c/a\u003e to participate in their \u003ca href=\"https://language.work/documentary/timeless-work/\" rel=\"follow\"\u003elanguage.work documentary\u003c/a\u003e, I took some time to reflect on how the structure of our work impacts both our experience of the world and our experience of time. The majority of us grow up in environments where time is structured for us. We go to school where we are subject to the bell, the rota, and the timetable. Our days and weeks are structured for us into time at school and time outside school, and the years are carved up into school and holidays. \u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eWe grow up taking for granted that our days are split into blocks of time that involve things we have to do (school or work, usually) and then time for things that we want to do.

Pamphlets decried laziness and promoted putting every moment of one\u0026rsquo;s time to good use. There was a widespread moralism about the use of time. As John Wesley, one of the founders of Methodism, wrote, \u0026ldquo;See that ye walk circumspectly, says the Apostle\u0026hellip; redeeming the time; saving all the time you can for the best purposes; buying up every fleeting moment out of the hands of sin and Satan, out of the hands of sloth, ease, pleasure, worldly business\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo; \u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eIn the three hundred years since the start of the shift from task-orientation to time-orientation, we\u0026rsquo;ve seen greater and greater emphasis on time.

Work can happen as the sun turns, and leaders will come to expect that results are what matters.\u0026rdquo;\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\r\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cspan\u003eSecondly, the tone must be set from the top. Sheela Subramanian explains how she used status messages to communicate her core working hours during the pandemic, making it clear that outside of those her role is caring for her two small children. \u0026ldquo;By showing my humanity, by showing the fact that I had multiple responsibilities, it gave an opportunity for others to feel like they could do the same thing.\u0026rdquo; \u003c/span\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\r\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cspan\u003eAnd the third suggestion, from Daphnee Laforest, founder of Modern Leaders, was to replicate an \u0026ldquo;open-source\u0026rdquo; philosophy, used by many software companies long before the pandemic. This is about giving anyone access to the code and allowing them to make suggestions and comments, in their own time. \u0026ldquo;You see a product evolving created by people who have never met in person, that might not be in the same country or the same time zone.\u0026rdquo; \u003c/span\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\r\n\u003c/ol\u003e\r\n\u003ch2\u003e\u003cspan\u003eThe hard truth about technology \u003c/span\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eWhile technology has enabled this new way of working, it can also make asynchronous working harder, due to the constant stream of notifications. \u003ca href=\"https://language.work/research/killing-time-at-work/?utm_medium=referral\u0026amp;utm_source=qatalog\u0026amp;utm_campaign=LW-documentary\u0026amp;utm_content=Timeless-work-blog\" rel=\"follow\"\u003eQatalog and GitLab research\u003c/a\u003e found that the average knowledge worker receives notifications from 6 applications every day, and 73% of workers respond to them outside their working hours.

As Laila von Albensleben explains, \u0026ldquo;...not only does new technology allow people to work asynchronously, but it also allows people to be mindful about when people receive that information\u0026hellip; with scheduled send, people don't necessarily feel the pressure to always be online and respond immediately.\u0026rdquo; \u003c/span\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\r\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cspan\u003eAdd breaks into your work calendar: \u0026ldquo;Guidelines encouraging people to actually schedule breaks in their calendars are critical.

When things get done, when colleagues aren\u0026rsquo;t bumping into blockers, but have the right set of tools that enable smooth teamwork and collaboration at their fingertips. There are normally a few people working behind the scenes to make that happen \u0026ndash;\u0026ndash; the ops team. They are the unsung heroes who enable individuals and teams to do the work they have set out to do and allow organizations to unlock their collective potential.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003ch2\u003eOperations in the modern workplace\u0026nbsp;\u003c/h2\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003eSo what is ops, and what do they do?\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003eIt\u0026rsquo;s much more than just keeping the lights on. Ben Gateley, CEO and Co-Founder of CharlieHR defines operations as \u0026ldquo;the foundation of any organization \u0026ndash;\u0026ndash; it\u0026rsquo;s the processes, the ways of working, the rhythm, the routines, and the policies that govern how a company does what it does.\u0026rdquo;\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003eGerisha Nadaraju, Head of BizOps at Dojo, refers to ops as enablers, \u0026ldquo;that\u0026rsquo;s actually what I do, enabling others to do their jobs better,\u0026rdquo; she explains.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003eBut the role can vary massively, depending on the nature of the organization.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003eFor Astrid Verstraete, Co-Founder of Operations Nation, a content hub for current and aspiring operations leaders, this role is hard to define, \u0026ldquo;it is so different according to the company\u0026hellip;however ultimately it comes down to creating processes, helping people navigate them and removing friction.\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003eSo how do they remove frictions and challenges your org might be facing?\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003eQatalog\u0026rsquo;s Chief of Staff, Marta Kutt, sees a lack of transparency as the leading culprit for workplace frustration. Breaking down silos between people and teams has become a key part of her role, \u0026ldquo;operations teams can find tools to help us work better\u0026hellip;if you don\u0026rsquo;t have silos if you know where you can find information people are much happier and can work as a team much better\u0026rdquo;.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003ch2\u003eEmpowering organizations to scale\u0026nbsp;\u003c/h2\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003eSo, we know that operations has a critical role to play in empowering teams. However, what works for a team of 50 will need to be reconfigured to work for a team of 5000. Having long-term vision within operations will allow your company to consistently reach the next level. Operations are the ones who do the heavy lifting and problem-solving related to key business challenges when it comes to scaling.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003eAccording to Mike Strange, Director of Operations at Just Eat for Business, ops always need to keep an eye on the future with everything they do in the present. \u0026ldquo;It\u0026rsquo;s what you need to start changing tomorrow, next week, or next month to enable the foundation for 10x growth in a few year's time\u0026rdquo;.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003ch2\u003eThe changing face of operations\u0026nbsp;\u003c/h2\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003eAs companies grow and layers of complexity are added, operations departments get pulled in different directions and become more specialized to better serve the needs of the business. It\u0026rsquo;s now become much more common to see product ops, sales ops, design ops, and marketing ops roles, which were few and far 10 years ago. However, this decentralization of operations may bring challenges of its own. \u0026ldquo;With this new trend we\u0026rsquo;re seeing we have to ask if operations are creating new frictions or new silos,\u0026rdquo; Verstraete says and warns that this is something business leaders need to keep a close eye on in the coming years.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003eThe other big challenge facing operations leaders has been the rise of remote and hybrid working. \u0026ldquo;Since switching to online we no longer have visibility on corridor conversations,\u0026rdquo; Strange explains. To counteract this, he advises catchups, standups, and even regularly becoming a fly on the wall in cross-functional conversations as techniques to identify emerging silos between colleagues and create processes that tear them down.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003ch2\u003eOperations and company culture\u0026nbsp;\u003c/h2\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003eThere is often a perception that operations is more the \u0026lsquo;boring stuff\u0026rsquo; - with a focus on the processes. But this is wide of the mark, as how your company operates ultimately defines the culture. It\u0026rsquo;s how you attract the best people, how you retain them, and how you get the most out of them\u0026hellip;it\u0026rsquo;s not a pool table in the office or drinks after work on Friday\u0026rdquo; - explained Gately.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003eHe also warns that the rise of remote work means organizations cannot leave culture to chance, as work has an even greater potential impact on our lives. \u0026ldquo;Workplaces have a responsibility to make sure that the experience that people have at work is a positive one.\u0026rdquo; To achieve that, operations must embed company values into processes and policies, and through it, into people.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003ch2\u003eThe people behind operations\u003c/h2\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003eThis outdated perception also risks dissuading people from starting a career in operations. However, it\u0026rsquo;s all about how you approach the role, whether you chose to focus on the analytics and processes or more on working with people so they achieve everything they set out to do. According to Strange, operations is a people-orientated role, it\u0026rsquo;s about asking the right questions and listening to the answers. \u0026ldquo;It\u0026rsquo;s people over process.\u0026rdquo;\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003eVerstraete tells us that to be successful in operations you need to be curious, you have to find problems and find creative solutions to solve them. And Kelsey Traher, COO of Marvel App adds \u0026ldquo;you have to firefight in the moment, while also keeping one eye on your long-term plan and the big picture\u0026rdquo;.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003eSo, for those considering a career in operations, we can conclude that every day will be different and it won\u0026rsquo;t always be plain sailing. However, there can be no doubt that operations now play a critical role in the success of almost any business, enabling everyone to work at their best. And, as work continues to become more complex, we\u0026rsquo;ll need them more than ever.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003eTo watch the episode, visit \u003ca href=\"https://language.work/documentary/?utm_medium=referral\u0026amp;utm_source=qatalog\u0026amp;utm_campaign=LW-documentary\u0026amp;utm_content=Operations-nation-blog\" rel=\"follow\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003elanguage.work\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e","summary":"Shining a spotlight on the critical role of operations in helping to drive growth and build culture in today's workplace.","seo_title":"Operations Nation documentary | Qatalog","meta_description":"The second episode summary of a documentary series on the staggering pace of change in the workplace.

We went from thousands of years of subsistence-based work to mass production and swapped farms for assembly lines and offices. While our setting and type of work changed, everything was still in person, and getting context on what was going on at work was simple \u0026ndash; you just had to ask the person next to you.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003eHowever, no one really came prepared for what happened next, when we swapped our physical offices for virtual ones. According to Tariq Rauf, Qatalog\u0026rsquo;s founder and CEO, \u0026ldquo;...the way in which we work is largely still influenced by the industrial revolution. We work 40 hours a week, we don\u0026rsquo;t work weekends.\u0026rdquo;\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;This is all a function of the production line. But the way we work today is very different from how we used to work in factories. You\u0026rsquo;re working in 17 different locations across seven different time zones\u0026rdquo; - he continued.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003eThe advancements in technology combined with the rapid adoption of new productivity tools, a trend accelerated by the pandemic, have together outpaced the speed at which workers can adapt. And this newfound complexity comes at the peril of our attention and focus.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003ch2\u003eThe rise of productivity apps\u0026nbsp;\u003c/h2\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003eWe now have thousands upon thousands of these apps. But most of the ones we have today were built with little respect for how we actually use them \u0026ndash; in tandem with each other. \u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eThis critical flaw has left workers at the mercy of an ever-expanding digital ether. Rauf explains this phenomenon as \u0026ldquo;the sea of apps we use to keep on top of our work that we end up drowning in\u0026rdquo;. Try to find anything and you\u0026rsquo;ll have to battle through a maze of productivity apps, all fighting for our attention, making it harder to do the work we want to do.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003ch2\u003eToday\u0026rsquo;s chaotic workplace\u003c/h2\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003eSo the app boom hasn\u0026rsquo;t been the silver bullet that we hoped for. \u0026ldquo;People are working in digital silos\u0026hellip;as a consequence, there's a lot of information pushed into apps, documents, files, and folders all over the organization with very few people knowing exactly where they are. Access to this information is getting more and more fragmented and people are losing their sense of context\u0026rdquo;, Rauf goes on to say.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003eQatalog partnered with Cornell University to understand the impact of productivity software on the way we work \u0026ndash; and its researchers found that we waste 59 minutes every day just trying to find information trapped in apps, laying bare the enormous cost of the productivity paradox we find ourselves in.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003eHema Thanki, VP of Product Marketing at Qatalog, says this impairs our ability to work effectively. \u0026ldquo;Information is locked in people\u0026rsquo;s heads making it very difficult to make the right calls, make the right decisions, and actually do your job.\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003eBut it\u0026rsquo;s not just productivity we have to worry about, many workers are also suffering from burnout. Cognitive capacity during the workday is a finite resource. Different apps that incessantly demand our attention end up abusing it, promoting an always-on culture that causes real damage to our mental health.

Tell them about the benefits you expect to see, both in terms of business performance and staff wellbeing.

To align this with your culture, set clear objectives and deadlines, and let people manage their own time to achieve them.

Two-thirds (66%) of workers surveyed in the report said they would consider looking for a new role if their ability to work flexible hours was removed or limited. This rate was even higher amongst those between the age of 21 and 34, rising to 76%.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003eAnd to hammer home the point, more than four in ten (43%) said they would consider taking a lower-paid role if it gave them more flexibility to choose when they work. Again, this sentiment was more common among the younger generation, at 48%.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003eBut what if workers had to choose between two extremes - would they still say the same? Well, we asked them that too. When forced to choose between a \u0026lsquo;9 to 5 schedule and 25 meetings per week\u0026rsquo; (the average number of meetings) and a company with \u0026lsquo;zero meetings and zero expectation of being online at specific times\u0026rsquo;, 62% of workers chose the latter.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003eThe consequences of this should be clear. With talent markets as hot as ever, it\u0026rsquo;s already difficult to attract and retain talent, and flexibility is now a key battleground as companies vie to attract the best people.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://cdn.buttercms.com/ieivY2ovTg2GqzP5Fh1p\" alt=\"undefined\" width=\"805\" height=\"396\" /\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat\u0026rsquo;s driven this change?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003eThe pandemic shook up the working world and gave everyone a taste of something different. It was desperately needed, too. We had worked the same way for decades \u0026ndash; commuting to an office to do work in the presence of others during a fixed window of time \u0026ndash; and we became used to it. Most of us never imagined that there could be a better way.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003eAnd now that workers have had a taste of an alternative, they don\u0026rsquo;t want to go back. Many people reassessed what is important to them in life. The flexibility to choose their own schedule meant they got to spend more time with friends and family, waste less time commuting, and opened up all sorts of opportunities that would have been much more difficult before.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003eFor example, 74% of those surveyed for the report said that increased schedule flexibility had allowed them to spend more time on hobbies, volunteering, and side hustles. As you\u0026rsquo;d imagine, this also had a significant and positive impact on people\u0026rsquo;s well-being. 65% of those regularly working asynchronously said that it had a positive impact on their wellbeing, compared to just 6% who said it had a negative impact.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://cdn.buttercms.com/uZ3VCDVCR8G3XwVIcMJ5\" alt=\"undefined\" width=\"770\" height=\"379\" /\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003eThis new, asynchronous way of working, allows people to do what matters to them and makes them happier.

We\u0026rsquo;re still learning what works and what doesn't, and it may be some time before new norms become firmly established. However, the long-term trajectory seems to be clear, because the younger generation (those aged 21-34 in this survey) consistently valued flexibility more highly.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://cdn.buttercms.com/UpaBZx2RhmpBIXfSnmmY\" alt=\"undefined\" width=\"805\" height=\"396\" style=\"font-family: sans-serif;\" /\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003eThe two most likely factors that explain this are a weaker attachment to pre-pandemic working patterns and familiarity with technology, as younger generations are tech natives, and tend to feel more comfortable working and collaborating online.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003eOf course, the younger workers of today will soon become the business leaders of tomorrow (if they are not already), which will likely result in a more widespread change in attitudes, once they start to make the rules. So, for anyone who still thinks flexible and asynchronous work is a short-term trend, this should be a wake-up call.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003ch3\u003eNon-negotiable employee needs\u003c/h3\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003eUltimately, if companies want to remain competitive, they can\u0026rsquo;t afford to get this wrong. Nearly all knowledge workers know what it\u0026rsquo;s like to work flexibly and they want more. When workers come to assess a prospective new job, they will look at the role itself, the salary, and the flexibility on offer. It is no longer a \u0026lsquo;nice-to-have\u0026rsquo; and, as we have just discovered, for younger generations it will be non-negotiable.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003eIn the end, the laggards will have to adapt or die, as asynchronous work is already proving to be a competitive advantage.

A deluge of notifications and emails pour into our laptops, tablets, and phones, delivering a constant rush of information, which grabs our attention with or without our consent. And it's only becoming worse, as we rely on tools and technology to support our asynchronous working world. This 24/7 notification firehose has encouraged and enabled a new form of digital presenteeism (which we also discussed in a previous blog post).\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003ch3\u003eDigital Workplace Presenteeism\u003c/h3\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003eDigital presenteeism has become a significant problem that leads to burnout, stress, and reduced productivity. The research revealed that 54% of us feel pressure to demonstrate to our colleagues that we are online and working, often outside our chosen working hours. As a result, the average knowledge worker now spends an extra 67 mins a day online in order to avoid suspicion that they\u0026rsquo;re not working hard enough.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003eIn a pre-remote world, we would signal to colleagues and our managers that we were working by being physically present in the office with them.

Moreover, 73% of folks receiving these notifications reply to them outside of their chosen working hours, with 30% saying they do this every single day. More than half of those surveyed also said they find it hard to switch off from work, with notifications ranked second as the second biggest reason.

Even when your phone isn't bugging you with the latest comment or update from your team, the problem of wanting to appear to be working still exists. That\u0026rsquo;s why it\u0026rsquo;s essential to implement guidelines and set expectations with your colleagues about when you\u0026rsquo;ll reply to their messages.

On average, this results in workers spending an extra 67 mins each day (5.5 hours a week!) online, in addition to normal working hours, as they attempt to avoid suspicion from colleagues and bosses that they are not working hard enough.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003eThis kind of digital presenteeism manifests as keeping your Slack status set to online, or replying to Teams messages from your mobile device while preparing dinner.

More than half of workers (54%) say their colleagues are stuck in old habits that make it hard to work asynchronously, while almost two-thirds of people (63%) believe that their managers prefer a \u0026lsquo;traditional culture with employees in the office.\u0026rsquo;\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003eOrganizations with this mindset, which prefer the traditional \u0026lsquo;bums-on-seats\u0026rsquo; approach to monitoring productivity, are going to be difficult to change. They are typically led by those who worry that providing more flexibility and allowing employees to manage their own time means giving up too much control. Even if that control was always an illusion. In addition, if workers aren\u0026rsquo;t in the office, but they still feel like they\u0026rsquo;re being measured by how long they spend working, they\u0026rsquo;ll do the next best thing, which means appearing to be online wherever they can.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003ch3\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eEffects of presenteeism in the workplace\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003eSome bosses will tell you that getting employees back in the office is good for business. The reality is that 81% of workers feel like they\u0026rsquo;re more productive, produce higher quality output, and are happier when they have flexibility over when they work.

This is likely to be compounded by a concern that performance will be measured incorrectly too, and will negatively impact pay reviews and promotions. All this points to a much deeper cultural problem that still thinks of work in terms of a production line. \u0026lsquo;The longer people are sitting in front of a conveyor belt, the more widgets they can make\u0026rsquo; - or so goes the logic.

This is really about communication and talking about the way you work as a team or company. Leaders and managers need to make it clear that this is the way you expect work to be done and continue to reinforce this in all of your communication with your team, whether that\u0026rsquo;s All-Hands Meetings or 121s.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003eBut talking alone will only get you so far. If employees still think they are being measured by other means, they will adapt their behavior accordingly. That\u0026rsquo;s why it\u0026rsquo;s critical that you change your recognition and reward structures, to make sure they are aligned with asynchronous working. Ultimately, this is about switching the emphasis from how many hours you work, to your output, and the value you create.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003eThe way to do this is to make explicitly clear what is expected of people and what good results look like. If you get it right, the end result should be that everyone can focus on getting their work done, confident in the knowledge they will be assessed on the successful delivery of it, rather than how quick they have been to respond to messages at 8 pm in the evening.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e","summary":"New research from Qatalog shows old habits from the physical office have been adopted in the digital workspace.

What changes is that meetings are no longer the default for whenever someone wants to have a discussion or provide an update. Instead, meetings are typically reserved for specific situations where synchronous communication is a necessity or desirable, often for consolidating work done async, or for more social interactions.

C-Suite execs know they can work to their own schedule, perhaps because they don\u0026rsquo;t fear questions from their team about where they are, or what they\u0026rsquo;re doing.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003eThere\u0026rsquo;s no good excuse for this kind of disparity today. For asynchronous working across an organization to be successful, it needs to apply to everyone. Business leaders need to put in the effort, build a framework, and encourage a culture that offers the benefits of async work to everyone.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003ch2\u003eMost people don\u0026rsquo;t know what async actually is\u003c/h2\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003eThe move to async working for most of the workforce is going to be substantial.

By contrast, once you understand the principles and methods behind asynchronous working, you'll see that it opens up options for flexibility, makes balancing work and life much, much easier, drives efficiency, and even provides a more profound enjoyment of your work.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003eBut you will also be in a much better position to make that change within your organization. You\u0026rsquo;ll begin to recognize when a meeting could be a written update, or how a Slack message could replace a phone call. You\u0026rsquo;ll start to understand the importance of creating a culture of documentation so that you don't have to ask for information, but have it readily available when you need it. This, in turn, will make you think more about what you need to provide to others for them to get their work done.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003ch2\u003eHow do we get started?\u003c/h2\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003eWorking async is not something that we\u0026rsquo;ve been trained to do. The vast majority of us have worked synchronously most of our working lives, and shifting to an asynchronous culture requires planning, patience, and deliberate practice. It doesn\u0026rsquo;t help that lots of our technology is biased towards real-time communication. Slack, Teams, and Zoom all demand our attention and pull us back into our synchronous ways. Even things like our workflows, processes, policies, and often employment contracts all point towards synchronous work.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003eThat\u0026rsquo;s why it can be a challenge for any organization to move to an asynchronous way of working, but the transition is critical if we want to continue enjoying flexibility in the way we work. The very first step is one of education and advocacy. People need to understand that there\u0026rsquo;s a better way of working before making the leap. Talk to your managers, the people team, and your colleagues about it. It doesn\u0026rsquo;t need to be an all-or-nothing big bang, you can begin to employ some of the mechanics of asynchronous working without waiting for the green light.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003ch2\u003eCommunication and planning\u003c/h2\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003eOne of those mechanics is around communication. Start by making more of an effort to communicate in a deliberate and thoughtful way. Hopefully, this will show that it\u0026rsquo;s possible to reduce the requirement for meetings in certain instances, and encourage others to do the same.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003eThe second is planning, which builds on the communication mechanism.\u0026nbsp; Planning requires you to set expectations around the work you or your team need to do. What are you trying to achieve and by what date? What expectation of quality or quantity is there around the work? Write these things down and communicate them to your colleagues, as this will reduce the likelihood of urgent requests and late-night questions. You\u0026rsquo;ll also need to make sure your colleagues know what you need to get your work done and give them a heads up well ahead of time.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003ch2\u003eUsing the right tools, in the right way\u003c/h2\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003eFinally, to create and maintain the asynchronous future that we all deserve, the tools we use must support this new way of working. On-demand, real-time chat, and video tools have their place but, when it comes to working asynchronously, choosing the right technology is a big part of the puzzle.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003eAt Qatalog, we live and breathe an asynchronous culture. There is a strong bias towards asynchronous communication and we ask everyone to model the behaviors we want to see, while being mindful of our colleagues' work patterns. We write things down, share them, and make them accessible. The Qatalog platform is at the heart of this, tying all of our work and communication together, and we\u0026rsquo;re more productive than we\u0026rsquo;ve ever been.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003c/p\u003e","summary":"Expectations around flexibility at work have changed.

Although, as the research reveals, we\u0026rsquo;ve still got a long way to go.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003ch3\u003eIs this a new era?\u003c/h3\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003eIt may seem hyperbolic to call it a \u0026ldquo;new era\u0026rdquo; but, for some, that\u0026rsquo;s exactly how it feels, as their working lives have changed beyond recognition. The daily commute is gone, replaced by a few steps to a workspace at home.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003eA select few have enjoyed the benefits of flexible hours and remote work for a while now, as some writers, developers, artists, and other similar roles have been able to work from home (or coffee shop) for the mainstay of their working lives. But even in this cohort of job types, most were still required to commute to an office, sit with their headphones on trying not to get distracted for eight hours, and then commute home again.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003eThe pandemic forced nearly every company with desk-bound workers into exactly the same situation. It wasn\u0026rsquo;t just the lucky few any longer. All the old arguments against working remotely - \u003cem\u003ehow do I know they\u0026rsquo;re working, how will we do creative work together, how will I manage people, how will I know what people are doing,\u0026nbsp;\u003c/em\u003eetc - quickly became irrelevant as offices shut their doors for months, and necessity forced a radical rethink.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003ch3\u003eWhat was all the fuss about?\u003c/h3\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003eDespite all the fears, work still happened. People talked online, companies didn\u0026rsquo;t fold and money was made. Once workers at home hit their stride and worked out the teething problems, they found they were happier, healthier, and in many cases, more productive.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003eHowever, with \u003cem\u003eeveryone\u003c/em\u003e at home, including partners, flatmates, and kids, getting work done became a bit more of a challenge for some. So, work got done in the windows of time between the demands of our personal lives. Flexible working arrangements started to emerge and the rigidity of the 9-5 slipped away. People started work early or worked late. They worked a few hours on the weekend or took more, or longer breaks to fit \u003cem\u003ereal life\u003c/em\u003e around work life.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003eAll at once, our collective eyes were opened that working remotely \u003cem\u003ecan and does work,\u0026nbsp;\u003c/em\u003eif it\u0026rsquo;s done right.

However, this change needs to be intentional and sustainable. Many of us work in a team, with others dependent on our work, so knowing when we can be contacted or when it is appropriate to book meetings is hugely important. That means companies will need to create clear flexible work guidelines, frameworks for communication, and provide workers with the tools that make asynchronous collaboration possible.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003ePerhaps you\u0026rsquo;re an early bird and leap out of bed, brush your teeth and you\u0026rsquo;re off.

Perhaps you\u0026rsquo;re neither but really enjoy working out in an empty gym or walking in the park in the morning to come up with new ideas.

Despite this, they all have one thing in common; they are still trying to figure out remote work.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003eMore than two years after the entire industry started working from home, it\u0026rsquo;s still proving a challenge. That got me thinking. . . why is it so hard, and how do we get it right?\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003ch3\u003eToo many tools\u0026nbsp;\u003c/h3\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003eFirst, some context. The tech industry has evolved unbelievably fast in the past two decades. We\u0026rsquo;ve built new technology for almost everything and incorporated it into how we work. We\u0026rsquo;ve acquired deep, specialized knowledge, created new, better ways of doing things, and new teams and functions to do them. That should have supercharged our productivity, but it came at the expense of simplicity. Now, with all this new complexity, we\u0026rsquo;ve lost the shared context among teams, there are silos everywhere, and it\u0026rsquo;s become harder and harder to actually get work done.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003eLet\u0026rsquo;s look at a modern software company. There are typically more than 10 teams involved in the development process. Front-end developers, back-end developers, devops, reliability engineers, data scientists, growth engineers, designers, product managers, project managers, and that\u0026rsquo;s only product. If everyone isn\u0026rsquo;t aligned, it breaks.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003eYet alignment has become harder because each team has a different set of tools and a unique way of working. Engineering might document tasks in JIRA and follow agile methodology, while the Design team uses Asana, Figma, and a design thinking approach. Product Managers use another shiny new thing. Sales and support, another still. Everyone ends up working in their own little silos, speaking their own languages.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003eMeanwhile, work across teams still needs to be done. So, we fall back on one of the three things teams still have in common: Email, Slack, and Zoom.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003ch3\u003eThe unholy trinity\u003c/h3\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003eEmail, Slack, and Zoom have become the de-facto coordination layer within a company. We send hundreds of emails and spend hours on calls, just telling people what we\u0026rsquo;re doing, translating it from one tool\u0026rsquo;s language into another.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003eCompany announcement? Email. Project update? Zoom. Looking for a doc? Slack. Who\u0026rsquo;s working on what? The dreaded \u0026ldquo;@here.\u0026rdquo; It\u0026rsquo;s pure brute force. Scale this process up to 5,000 people and it falls apart completely.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003eBut it\u0026rsquo;s not realistic to expect Email, Slack, or Zoom to be the foundational coordination layer of your business. These tools don\u0026rsquo;t have enough structure. They weren\u0026rsquo;t built for it. We default to them because they\u0026rsquo;re the one thing everyone still has in common. A lot like a tourist grunting and gesticulating to get by in a foreign country where they don\u0026rsquo;t speak the language. But we can\u0026rsquo;t operate this way at scale.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003eCornell University\u0026rsquo;s Idea Lab partnered with Qatalog to investigate this idea.

Now, it\u0026rsquo;s wasting our time, driving us apart, and causing mistakes. It has failed. We\u0026rsquo;ve lost our shared context and we\u0026rsquo;re forced to operate at our company\u0026rsquo;s lowest common denominator: Slack, Email, and Zoom. We spend hours in these systems each week, translating our work from one language to another. It has become unsustainable. According to Asana\u0026rsquo;s Anatomy of Work Index, it now consumes over 60% of working time. That\u0026rsquo;s not just a problem, it\u0026rsquo;s a fatal flaw in the way we\u0026rsquo;re working today.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003ch3\u003eAnarchy or tyranny?\u003c/h3\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003eIn my experience, once companies identify the issue, they go down one of two paths:\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003e1) Total anarchy - \u0026ldquo;Let everyone use whatever tool, system, or methodology they want. We\u0026rsquo;ll deal with it.\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003eAs the company grows, teams will get disconnected from each other and any work happening outside their own bubble.

For me, DesignOps is about supporting and enabling those designers to do what they do. We are a centralized function that supports a decentralized team, and we have to scale alongside the design org, to ensure we can continue to support each of our design verticals.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eFrances Yllana:\u003c/b\u003e I support a growing 70+ person civic design and technology team of designers, researchers, engineers and delivery leaders.

That\u0026rsquo;s supporting career growth and development, optimizing tooling and project frameworks, encouraging better collaboration across teams and departments and much more. This work has always been done or needed, but it\u0026rsquo;s still relatively new as its own discipline, so we still have a chance to define what DesignOps can be.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eSarah Klein: \u003c/b\u003eI would echo what Kamdyn and Frances said. Thinking about my role at Cisco, I would also add that it\u0026rsquo;s about allowing people within your organization to see the value of design, and \u003cb\u003eensuring that designers have a voice that is listened to\u003c/b\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003e. This means we can start to bring design thinking into requirement setting processes, where previously it was just design-focused conversations.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eKamdyn: \u003c/b\u003eYes, that\u0026rsquo;s interesting, because we have structured our team around two strands of DesignsOps roles now. We have the type that Sarah describes, which is about the execution of the design work itself, and they are much closer to the end product and business decisions. Then we have folks who are focused on the designer experience, \u003cb\u003eprioritizing the people aspect, which involves onboarding, talent, growth, culture and the sense of belonging\u003c/b\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003e.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003ch3\u003e\u003cb\u003eThe crucial role of DesignOps in the new world of work\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eFrances: \u003c/b\u003eWith the rise of hybrid and remote work, DesignOps becomes much more important in every sized organization.

And over the past two years the shift to new ways of working has forced companies to look again at all of these things. This means we have the opportunity to implement very meaningful changes in our organizations, which gives us a critically important role.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eSarah: \u003c/b\u003eBuilding on what I said earlier, the increased prominence of designers within Cisco can largely be credited to leaders that now embrace human-centered design and see value in transforming from an engineering centered org to more of a design-centered org. That is something that DesignOps has helped facilitate and naturally, means we, as DesignOps leaders, have a bigger seat at the table too.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003ch3\u003e\u003cb\u003eBalancing a tech first and a human approach\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eSarah: \u003c/b\u003eAs a large organization, one of the biggest challenges we face is communicating across large teams and across departments to get alignment on objectives. We\u0026rsquo;ve taken a balanced approach, making use of certain software tools, implementing certain processes, but also thinking about our culture more widely. It\u0026rsquo;s always going to be a combination of these things to sew it all together, but it\u0026rsquo;s a constant work in progress to stay aligned. It doesn\u0026rsquo;t stop.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eKamdyn: \u003c/b\u003eAt Spotify, we place a lot of value on giving designers autonomy, but that extends to tools too. That does mean there is some fragmentation, which can be difficult to manage, as it means we have information spread across tools like Excel, Jira, Coda, and every single project management tool you can imagine. Our job is then to figure out the tools that people feel incentivized to use to stay connected.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eFrances: \u003c/b\u003eWe collaborate with so many different experts and clients, each of them with their own ways of working and systems. \u003cb\u003eThat\u0026rsquo;s why a single source of truth is so important\u003c/b\u003e, as it means when someone pings the team asking a question, you can point them to the relevant resource that already exists. This is crucial for ensuring consistent delivery and quality control. But everyone learns differently. So we\u0026rsquo;ve also done some work to ensure there are different ways of consuming that knowledge, whether it\u0026rsquo;s a video, information cards, or training sessions we can arrange when needed.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003ch3\u003e\u003cb\u003eBuilding consensus with distributed teams\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eSarah:\u003c/b\u003e It can definitely be difficult to build consensus remotely, but we\u0026rsquo;ve been distributed for a long time at Cisco, so it\u0026rsquo;s something we have got used to. We generally take a human-centered approach, because when you have people from multiple orgs coming together to make a decision, frequently the blocker is personal. That\u0026rsquo;s where we as DesignOps folks have been able to come in and \u003cb\u003ebreak down those walls and have more human conversations to remove those points of friction.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eKamdyn: \u003c/b\u003eWhenever I look at a problem our team is trying to solve, I often think about what we are optimizing for. Because if you are focused on consensus, you are not necessarily optimizing for speed. There may be situations where a consensus approach doesn\u0026rsquo;t make sense, because speed is important, and a disagree and commit approach is more valuable. Knowing what you are optimizing for helps you to focus on moving forward in the right way.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003ch3\u003e\u003cb\u003eSetting up a knowledge base\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eKamdyn:\u003c/b\u003e When you have an organization as big as ours, the reality is that you can\u0026rsquo;t just have one centralized place where all of this information lives. That exists, and it hosts our main design system, but we also need something for each vertical that is unique to their needs, which then ties back to the centralized place. It\u0026rsquo;s more of a hub and spoke model. We then have individual programme managers in the DesignOps team who are responsible for each of those verticals, and that\u0026rsquo;s the only area they have to focus on, which means they become specialized.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eFrances: \u003c/b\u003eKnowledge bases are great, but being able to see who worked on a project is critical too because it means you have the ability to go and ask that person questions, and there are always some important bits of tacit knowledge that weren\u0026rsquo;t captured. Something else we do is to curate \u0026lsquo;Brown Bag\u0026rsquo; sessions with key individuals, often external people, which we record and add to our knowledge base. That means anyone who joins the company later on, can still \u003cb\u003eaccess those insights on demand when they need it\u003c/b\u003e.

It\u0026rsquo;s a Work Hub that centralizes your people, teams, projects, goals, documentation and processes. Think of it as the single source of truth for work \u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003ethat makes cross-functional initiatives visible, processes more efficient, and gives your work structure.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eThere are lots of productivity tools already. Why is Qatalog needed?\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003eThe \u0026lsquo;software for work\u0026rsquo; market is enormous and has produced some of Silicon Valley\u0026rsquo;s biggest success stories. But the reality is that innovation has been stagnant for a very long time. We\u0026rsquo;re still using primitive tools that have remained the same for many decades.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003eYes, they have slicker UI and more granular features, but the foundational structure of these products has barely changed. Slack is effectively the same as Internet Relay Chat from the 1980s. Microsoft Word\u0026rsquo;s original incarnation in 1983 looks remarkably similar to today\u0026rsquo;s. Dropbox is an online version of the same file manager that\u0026rsquo;s existed for almost forty years.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003eThe consequence of this stagnation is that the productivity software we use doesn\u0026rsquo;t actually make us more productive. It has failed in its promise. This is largely due to the fact that while the products themselves haven\u0026rsquo;t really changed, their scale has increased massively, often by ten or even one-hundred times. Suddenly, you have 5,000 or 10,000 person organizations using software that was initially designed by a small team for another small team. The ergonomics don\u0026rsquo;t fit and it starts to break.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003eQatalog is different because we set out to solve this challenge from day-one. Our goal was always to build something that considers how organizations actually function at scale and help them to operate and collaborate efficiently.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eWhy have you thought about the problem differently, do you think?\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003ePerhaps it\u0026rsquo;s just a difference of perspective. I am a trained architect and I specialized in large technical and transport buildings. I\u0026rsquo;ve worked on designs for an airport terminal for 60 million people annually and a $400m large scale cancer research center. My mentor was Charles Correa, who designed these buildings, and the experience was transformational.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003eWhen designing these types of buildings, you always have to think about how many people are going to be in that space. Take the airport terminal, which might have more than 200,000 people using it on some days. With that many people, you need corridors of a certain width, a certain number of toilets, check in counters, gates, runways, and so on. If you don\u0026rsquo;t get one of these right, everything falls apart. Thankfully, we know what works, because these are analog-native solutions that have been iterated on, tried and tested over decades and sometimes centuries.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003eBut when it comes to the workplace in the digitally native world, engineers and designers are still figuring out what works at scale, and you need to think from first principles to deliver an experience that\u0026rsquo;s new.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eHave we built true digitally native solutions in any other industries?\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003eYes. Tinder, Airbnb and Uber are examples of great digitally native solutions. They all work by leveraging economies of choice and scale that just cannot be replicated offline. You can\u0026rsquo;t meet 100 people in 10 minutes as you can on Tinder, you\u0026rsquo;ll never have a friend with a spare room in every city, as you can on Airbnb, and you cannot connect to every taxi driver within a mile radius as you can on Uber. These are all entirely new possibilities enabled by the digital paradigm, rather than skeuomorphic digital solutions to an analog problem.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eAnd how does this compare to Qatalog and work software?\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003eWhen you look at work software today, most are first order solutions to collaborating online, addressing a single use case. Notion for documentation, Asana for task management, Slack for messaging, and so on. This generation of software does not understand who each person is in a chat, document or file. It doesn\u0026rsquo;t know which teams they\u0026rsquo;re on, what projects they\u0026rsquo;re part of, or what their objectives are. Nor does it have any metadata meaningful enough to automate lots of the manual work around their jobs.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003eAt Qatalog, we\u0026rsquo;ve rebuilt the organization itself, along with its people, its teams, and projects, and made it digitally native, whilst allowing information to flow naturally between these entities. This allows it to understand intentions, objectives, and org-charts, and it has the necessary metadata to automate a lot of the grunt work.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eTaking a step back, how did you go from being an architect to a founder of a software company?\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003eSoftware was actually my first passion. I was born in India and started coding when I was around six years old. We later moved to Saudi Arabia for my father\u0026rsquo;s work, which led me to start my first business when I was twelve. He was a photocopier salesman who sold computers on the side and I would talk to his clients about their computer problems and build them software for managing databases with Microsoft Access.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003eMy second business came a bit later, when I was around 17. By this point I had moved back to India to focus more on my education. It was a software consultancy that advised on complex system design, covering everything from large-scale booking systems, websites to building bespoke technical software. That was when I first started to think seriously about how to build software for scale, and it also gave me a taste for business.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eGiven all of that, what made you decide to study architecture?\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003ePeople ask me this a lot. While I loved coding and computer science, I had taught myself so much outside of formal education, and I knew that would continue without a formal setup. Architecture was a brand new challenge that combined lots of the engineering and design problems that I love about computer science. It also gave me a new creative outlet for my interest in software.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003eIn those days it was also quite rare to design buildings using software and by the time I graduated I had won two national architecture awards. All of this helped to open doors that would normally have been closed to someone of my age. That was how I landed my role with Charles Correa, who is credited with the creation of modern architecture in post-independence India. He was my mentor, and we worked on some iconic projects all over the world, such as the \u003ca href=\"https://www.fchampalimaud.org/champalimaud-foundation/champalimaud-centre\" rel=\"follow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eChampalimaud Center\u003c/a\u003e in Lisbon, the \u003ca href=\"https://www.dezeen.com/2015/06/04/charles-correa-completes-crystalline-islamic-centre-ismaili-toronto-aga-khan-museum-canada/\" rel=\"follow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eIsmaili Center \u003c/a\u003ein Toronto, the Mahindra Research Valley in Chennai and a bunch of other projects.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eAnd so why didn\u0026rsquo;t you continue on that career path?\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003eI had never really moved away from software, and I found myself wanting to focus more of my time on it. It takes years for blueprints to become a building, and there\u0026rsquo;s something magical about writing lines of code and seeing the result in a matter of seconds. I was still doing some software consultancy on the side so, when one of my clients asked me to come to Oxford (UK) and work on projects to find new IP applications for NASA, I made the leap.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eWhat came next?\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003eIn 2014, I joined Transferwise (now Wise), leading the Product \u0026amp; Engineering teams responsible for driving new users. I eventually got on Amazon\u0026rsquo;s radar and they invited me to work on similar projects, but on a global scale. I worked on projects spanning Prime, Prime Video, Alexa and Twitch with hundreds of colleagues in teams stretched across 32 different floors and 17 different countries.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003eWork was about as disjointed as it could get. The Alexa organization alone was around 8,000 people, with all kinds of dependencies on the Video organization of another 4,000 people. I started to notice valuable nodes sticking out between the two teams that would fail to connect. Despite Amazon\u0026rsquo;s incredible documentation culture, there was nothing that could bring everything, from internal wikis, to messages, teams, initiatives, together in one place.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eAnd this was when the idea for Qatalog was planted?\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003eYes. Everywhere you looked, there was the same fundamental flaw in the modern workplace. The design was messy, the system was breaking, there were huge inconsistencies from team to team. A lot of these costs were paid by employing more humans, incurring more manual effort to make it all work together. Work was not working, and the architect in me was screaming. This was a valuable ergonomic problem, and there had to be a systemic solution. That\u0026rsquo;s when I saw the potential to create something that tied all of this together into a single source of truth. The day after I got my permanent residency in the UK in 2019, I left Amazon to start Qatalog.\u003c/p\u003e","summary":"Blueprints for a new way of work.

Teammates are overburdened, managers don\u0026rsquo;t know how to navigate the situation, and business results suffer.

Solutions include manager training, process guidance, checklists, coverage planning frameworks, career coaching, budget to give spot bonuses to the coverage team or bring in a contractor, a formalized return program that includes re-training and networking, and thoughtful processes around career progression, promotion, and performance reviews in the context of parental leave.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003eThe good news is we have seen that with the right support, parental leave can actually be a positive inflection point for an employee\u0026rsquo;s career.

There used to be bigger barriers to starting your own business, but so much has changed that makes it easier for people to do so.

We spoke with Jennifer Leary, Head of Revenue Enablement at the French insurtech unicorn Shift Technology, about her onboarding experience during the pandemic and how organizational culture impacts everyone's day-to-day.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003e\u003cb\u003eHow would you describe the organizational culture at Shift?\u0026nbsp;\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003eShift is based in Paris and in my general observation \u0026mdash; albeit early having been there just shy of one year \u0026mdash; is that there is a slightly different culture around remote work than in the US, particularly in high-growth or tech companies. More urgency to get back to the office and less familiarity with remote work and hybrid schedules has been more of the norm at HQ versus in other parts of the world, particularly in the US. As of today, we are planning to have a hybrid structure moving forward and that seems to be working well.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003e\u003cb\u003eYou joined Shift during the pandemic, how was your onboarding experience?\u0026nbsp;\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003eExcellent. I intentionally joined a company where I would be \u0026ldquo;the remote office\u0026rdquo; (I am in Boston) and wasn\u0026rsquo;t sure what to expect. Having run onboarding myself in the past, I was super impressed to see the international FedEx arrive (on time) with Shift swag (mug, notebook, etc.), my laptop with instructions, and a schedule for Shift Academy \u0026mdash; our corporate onboarding scheduled for the following week. All for an org that at the time has fewer than 300 employees and a tiny HR staff.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003e\u003cb\u003eWhat are some of the biggest friction points in working across remote teams?\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003eI would say the number one experience that is challenging to replicate in remote teams is the interpersonal exchanges that happen outside of regularly scheduled meetings: hallway chats, grabbing coffee, walking to your car/public transit \u0026mdash; for that matter running into someone during public transit to or from the office. Even in business interactions, this is where some of the best personal connections are made and problems are solved. No matter how many Zoom cocktail hours an organization sponsors, I\u0026rsquo;ve yet to see it replicate this same experience. And in my work in start-ups, an effort to schedule a coffee break in between meetings is tough given the typical workload and meeting schedule.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003e\u003cb\u003eWhat \"future of work\" topics are you paying close attention to?\u0026nbsp;\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003eReturn to office, flexible schedules (aka the four-day workweek), data on productivity pre/post-pandemic, and real estate and commercial construction (where and for who). As managers and employees, we\u0026rsquo;re in a unique time where the job market, particularly in the US, is very strong and candidates have choices. Remote work and flexibility on location are considered key competitive differentiators so organizations need to be prudent when making decisions around work preferences, carefully weighing the pros and cons for the employee and what makes the most financial sense for the business.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003eIt\u0026rsquo;s really interesting being part of the leadership team at Shift where different countries present and support different work styles.

It speaks to an important factor in remote collaboration: it\u0026rsquo;s easier to feel like part of a team when you can see what bigger-picture outcomes you and your teammates are contributing to.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003e2.

The report notes, \"There's a disconnect between the ostensibly high levels of satisfaction with remote work and the actual pain people are feeling day-to-day.\" Why do you think this is the case?\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePeople can sense that the pros of autonomy and added flexibility are worth fighting for, and are very tangible outcomes of an intentional shift to remote. However, it takes work to reach utopia. In the here-and-now, pandemic-related stressors are compounded by a reality that many workforces were not equipped to be excellent at remote work right away. Short-term pain is being felt as we work towards long-term benefits from building remote fluency.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003e4. One interesting statistic from the Remote Work Report is that 70% of organizations still default to tools (video, chat, and phone) used for office-centric, largely synchronous workflows. If a global pandemic won't change habits here, what will?\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe pandemic has shifted minds. Minds will change before process, as process is a slow-changing organism. Smaller, more nimble organizations can easily pivot to new tools. Larger organizations must consider switching costs and legacy connections. It will likely take several years for the data to show that change is happening on the process front, but the seed has been planted on the mentality front.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003e5. What would you say to organizations that are thinking about shifting from a remote work model to a hybrid one?\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHybrid-remote is a popular alternative, but one that should be embraced with great deliberation, care, and intentionality. Hybrid-remote generally requires more effort to execute well than all-collocated or all-remote given the \u003ca href=\"https://about.gitlab.com/company/culture/all-remote/what-not-to-do/\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003etwo-tier work environment\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003e. Consider hiring a Head of Remote or designating a leader to ensure that all workflows and policies are audited and ported to remote-first, ensuring that work is as location-agnostic as possible.

We\u0026rsquo;ve started this program as a way to engage and learn from global business leaders who are championing new ways of work. We\u0026rsquo;re kicking things off with Jim Kalbach, MURAL\u0026rsquo;s Chief Evangelist. Jim\u0026rsquo;s commitment to \u0026ldquo;leveraging collective imagination\u0026rdquo; has inspired us, and we\u0026rsquo;re pleased to share our recent interview with him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eQatalog: The \u0026ldquo;future of work\u0026rdquo; topic is receiving a lot of attention.

The trends we\u0026rsquo;re watching include things like:\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eFacilitation\u003c/strong\u003e.\u0026nbsp;We believe facilitation skills will become more of a priority as a result of increased distributed teams. You don\u0026rsquo;t have to be a trained Facilitator (with a capital F) to facilitate: anyone leading a conversation can benefit from knowing how to drive towards the desired outcomes.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eVisual methods\u003c/strong\u003e. Visualizing work not only builds alignment and increases engagement, it also accelerates problem solving. Frameworks like the business model canvas show that visualizations aren\u0026rsquo;t only for creative disciplines.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eRemote work\u003c/strong\u003e. Of course, here at MURAL we\u0026rsquo;re committed to continue to understand the remote condition. We learned a lot in 2020, but we\u0026rsquo;re really just getting started in general.\u0026nbsp;\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eQ: \u0026ldquo;2020 was about emergency distributed work, 2021 is about optimization for distributed work.\u0026rdquo; Do you agree?\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eJ:\u003c/strong\u003e Yes, I do agree: remote collaboration took off in 2020 out of necessity. Moving forward we\u0026rsquo;ll likely see two things. First, the optimization of distributed work, as you say, which includes not only new tools but behaviors. That\u0026rsquo;s really the frontier we need to work on collectively. How do we better engage remote teams? How do we bring clients into creative conversations in a distributed setting? The list of questions goes on, and we\u0026rsquo;re still learning as we go.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut also I think we\u0026rsquo;ll start to see a shift towards partially distributed collaboration as some people start going back to the office post-vaccine, perhaps in the second half of the year. The challenge of hybrid meetings\u0026mdash;where half of the team is in-person together and the other half is distributed\u0026mdash;is achieving equality of interaction. It\u0026rsquo;s easier for in-person conversations to out-pace those with folks dialed in and to interact with materials in the room.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI believe that what the working world learned about remote collaboration in 2020 will stick. That is, we\u0026rsquo;ll continue to think and work digitally even as we slowly head back to our offices later in 2021.\u0026nbsp;\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eQ: What kind of organizational cultures do you think best serve those adapting to distributed work?\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eJ:\u003c/strong\u003e Culture does play a big role, and the ones that adapt best already have the necessary qualities to adapt to effective distributed work. For example, we\u0026rsquo;ve found some of these cultural aspects to be most important:\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eEncouraging engagement\u003c/strong\u003e\u003ci\u003e.\u003c/i\u003e Distributed work is best when people can participate and stay interactive with the group. Otherwise, it\u0026rsquo;s far too easy to drift off and multi-task on something else and not contribute. Work cultures that seek engagement from everyone in the group thrive better in distributed contexts.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eInclusion of diverse perspectives\u003c/strong\u003e.

Failing needs to be OK: If you get it wrong, that\u0026rsquo;s OK\u0026mdash;you\u0026rsquo;ll learn from your mistakes and move on. People have to feel safe about contributing creative ideas, even if they end up failing.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eQ: What's the biggest challenge for you and your team at work these days? And how do you work on overcoming it?\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eJ:\u003c/strong\u003e As a company, MURAL has changed dramatically in the last year. Of course, we\u0026rsquo;ve been advocating for \u003ca href=\"https://www.mural.co/ebook\" rel=\"follow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eimproving remote work\u003c/a\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003e for years and we believe we have a solution that can help. When companies found themselves \u0026ldquo;\u003c/span\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.mural.co/blog/suddenly-remote-recap\" rel=\"follow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003esuddenly remote\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003e\u0026rdquo; because of the pandemic, we were there to help, e.g., with content, guidance, extended offers, etc.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut there\u0026rsquo;s no doubt that our business grew at the same time. We\u0026rsquo;ve tripled the size of the company, and we received \u003ca href=\"https://www.mural.co/press-releases/series-b\" rel=\"follow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eSeries B funding\u003c/a\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003e. Although we\u0026rsquo;ve always been a remote-first company\u0026mdash;with global teams on four continents\u0026mdash;any organization would struggle to scale under this rapid growth.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo our challenge was less around how we work remotely than it was how do we scale as a remote company to meet market demand.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eQ: It's believed by some within the creative industry that there's no real substitute for face-to-face collaboration. Do you agree with that? How are you addressing this idea at MURAL?\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eJ:\u003c/strong\u003e Yes, I agree with that sentiment on one level. In fact, one of our guidelines for good remote collaboration is to \u0026ldquo;meet in person.\u0026rdquo; If you know your colleagues personally, remote collaboration is a lot easier.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut you could also say there is no substitute for distributed collaboration as well. So I find it problematic viewing face-to-face collaboration as all or nothing, black and white. The reality of our modern work environments should best be seen as a continuum of modes\u0026mdash;from completely in-person collaboration to hyper-distributed teams. You have to be able to function across a range of modes and settings, and be able to move between them as well.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt MURAL we\u0026rsquo;re committed to developing best practices for digital collaboration, whether in-person or distributed. For instance, \u003ca href=\"https://www.mural.co/blog/5-tactics-seamless-remote-work\" rel=\"follow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ehere\u0026rsquo;s a short post I wrote a while back summarizing some techniques for moving between modes of collaboration\u003c/a\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003e. And we continue to learn new techniques from our community. As work moves back to the office post-pandemic, we\u0026rsquo;ll be watching closely how customers and partners think and work digitally, and how the line between in-person and remote blurs.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe\u0026rsquo;ve also built capabilities into our platform to make the transition easier. MURAL Scan is still in beta, but will be released soon. With it, you can scan a wall of physical sticky notes and drawings, and digitize them to a mural canvas instantly.\u0026nbsp;\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eQ: You've been running innovation and design workshops for a while now. What are your strategies for facilitating successful collaboration?\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eJ: \u003c/strong\u003eThere are lots of details to consider, many of which we captured in our book, \u003ca href=\"https://www.mural.co/ebook\" rel=\"follow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eFacilitating Remote Workshops\u003c/a\u003e. But at a high level, there are two overarching principles that guide my style of remote facilitation.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe first is to \u003cb\u003edesign an experience\u003c/b\u003e for the workshop in advance. When I give in-person workshops, I can improvise some of it on the spot. It\u0026rsquo;s also possible to observe progress in a room and determine if a person or group is lost. In remote settings, that\u0026rsquo;s harder to do.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLaying out your workshop visually in MURAL forces you to break things down and get more granularity. Instead of 30-minute chunks of time, you want to think in 10-minute or even 5-minute chunks. \u003ci\u003eAnd you want to be much more explicit about your instructions: don\u0026rsquo;t leave anything to chance\u003c/i\u003e. This requires more upfront planning and preparation, but you gain that time back afterward with reduced consolidation and transcription time.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe second thing to consider is how to \u003cb\u003emaintain engagement\u003c/b\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003e. You have to get creative on how you can involve others and get their participation with the tools available to you. I find using a range of inputs and planning for frequent calls for participation increases engagement. For instance, you might share your audio and video with a conferencing tool like Zoom. But also consider how you can use the chat function for quick polls and inputs. Or use an online polling tool like Menti for live input. Adding interaction in a MURAL canvas increases the engagement even more.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen you put it all together\u0026mdash;a designed experience with frequent engagement\u0026mdash;you can not only keep a group\u0026rsquo;s attention for four or more hours, you also get better results.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eQ: Tell us more about the Jobs To Be Done toolkit. We're especially interested in how it could be used to advocate for change.\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eJ:\u003c/strong\u003e The \u003ca href=\"https://www.jtbdtoolkit.com/\" rel=\"follow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eJTBD Toolkit\u003c/a\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003e is a follow-up project to my book, The\u003c/span\u003e \u003ca href=\"https://rosenfeldmedia.com/books/jobs-to-be-done-book/\" rel=\"follow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eJTBD Playbook\u003c/a\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003e. The two complement each other. The book covers a lot of ground work and points to other resources to learn more. It\u0026rsquo;s really a hub of resources to get started with. The Toolkit focuses on deepening knowledge and skills around core concepts of JTBD, so it\u0026rsquo;s a lot more focused. We also offer live workshops each month through the Toolkit. Combined with our monthly webinar, it\u0026rsquo;s really a place for ongoing conversations and learning around the topic of JTBD.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor me, Jobs To Be Done is a way of seeing the people you serve independent of technology or solutions, including your own. This gives you a new and unique perspective on your business and points to hidden opportunities. The techniques of JTBD guide you in finding new possibilities through a structured language of analysis and techniques for modeling human behavior.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eQ: And finally, tell us what work-life balance means to you today?\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eJ:\u003c/strong\u003e Great question. Not sure if anyone really knows the answer to that, do they? But one thing I\u0026rsquo;m finding more and more is people seeking purposeful, meaningful work. Employers pay you in money, which is a renewable resource for them. In return, you give them your time, which is a finite resource you never get back. If you\u0026rsquo;re going to spend ⅓ of your day working on something, it should be meaningful and rewarding to you.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo, yes: things like flex-time and the option to work from home may contribute to better work-life balance. For sure, we want colleagues at MURAL to have that control over their time and work. But at a deeper level, working for something you really care about brings work-life balance as well.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e","summary":"If you had to introduce yourself in one sentence, what would you say?

You let your colleagues into your work home. Not the work home with the new backdrop setup for Zoom meetings.
