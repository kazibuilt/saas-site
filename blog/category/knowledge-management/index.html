They need a structure that enables people to create, store, and navigate it effectively.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003eImagine you go into a massive library, but there\u0026rsquo;s no system or structure.

You might have already started with a \u003ca href=\"https://qatalog.com/blog/post/qatalog-vs-company-wiki-notion-confluence/\"\u003e\u003cspan\u003ecompany wiki, like Notion or Confluence\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cspan\u003e, which works perfectly fine to begin with. But as a company scales, and as more and more knowledge is created and documented, things will start to fall apart.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003eTake Notion as an example. Its structure is defined by its two core building blocks of pages and tables, which can be linked together in lots of different ways. Beyond that, the structure is highly customizable and entirely up to you to decide. This level of customization can be incredibly powerful. But it also means anyone can make edits or changes to that structure, whether that\u0026rsquo;s creating new pages or editing existing ones. In most cases, unless it\u0026rsquo;s managed very carefully, it\u0026rsquo;s likely to break once you\u0026rsquo;ve got more than 50 people using it.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003eOr it might be that the structure isn\u0026rsquo;t intuitive, so nobody can actually use it. Either way, the results are the same. People aren\u0026rsquo;t sure where or how to store information, meaning\u0026nbsp; they either don\u0026rsquo;t add new information, it goes in the wrong place, or it\u0026rsquo;s duplicated. The single source of truth is undermined, it becomes ever more difficult to find what they need, and the system itself loses value. As a result, everything takes longer. Information gets lost. Frustration peaks. And people simply give up.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003eBut what if that information were there all along, but you didn\u0026rsquo;t know where to look? This will happen without a clear structure. And the issue starts to get a whole lot worse if you\u0026rsquo;re growing fast and teams start to use different tools. For example, you might find long-time employees still using Confluence, while newer teams start using Notion without telling anyone \u0026mdash; with no way of searching \u003cspan\u003eacross\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan\u003e both tools.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003eAll of this results in duplication, or a new, skewed version of the truth.

People are now focused on work/life integration. Remote leaders need to change their mindset accordingly.

Remote team leaders often fear losing control over performance. When you focus on results, however, you pay attention to output rather than input. To do so, start by establishing measurable goals in partnership with the employee. Communicate expectations clearly, monitor progress, and hold people accountable. Perhaps most importantly, recognize and reward success regularly.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003ch2\u003e\u003cspan\u003eBe deliberate about innovation\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eAt the same time, creativity requires a different mindset than performing goal-oriented tasks. When you schedule a brainstorming session, it's important that you are intentionally clear about the meeting's purpose. Team members may be coming from several videoconference meetings in which their role was to listen to the presenters. Let people know in advance that you expect them to come with ideas and to engage actively in the conversation.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eI've used a fun activity to help my team practice being innovative.

But the more people who have to access, use and grow knowledge, the more sophisticated a knowledge management system needs to become.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003eSo what do we really mean by \u0026ldquo;knowledge\u0026rdquo;?\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003ch2\u003eDifferent types of knowledge\u003c/h2\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003eThere are three basic kinds of knowledge:\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003col\u003e\r\n\u003cli\u003eExplicit knowledge is that which is already codified. In other words, someone, somewhere has recognized its value, brought it together, and recorded it. That means other people can access and use it. Examples could include staff directories, contact databases or desk notes.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/li\u003e\r\n\u003cli\u003eImplicit knowledge is knowledge that isn\u0026rsquo;t codified in this way, but which could be without too much difficulty. It\u0026rsquo;s often the fine detail of exactly how to do something \u0026mdash; what could be referred to as \u0026ldquo;know-how\u0026rdquo;. An example might be knowing how to get around a glitch in an app.\u003c/li\u003e\r\n\u003cli\u003eTacit knowledge is another form of uncodified knowledge. But unlike implicit knowledge, it\u0026rsquo;s difficult to articulate and hence to record. And that makes it particularly challenging to pass on to other people. Examples include leadership skills and knowing how to make a sale.\u003c/li\u003e\r\n\u003c/ol\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003eAll these different types of knowledge can be equally important.

What's the underlying goal? As you start to answer these questions, you should trace your KPIs to an overall company goal or mission. Once you understand what your KPIs are trying to achieve, group your KPIs and write a goal that explains the importance of these KPIs. This goal gives you your objective. From there, you can turn your KPIs into key results by attaching goals.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003ch3\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eIdentify the scope of your goal\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003eThe scope of a goal looks at all aspects of the plan. It helps you and your team agree on precisely what needs to happen to achieve your goals. It also gives you space to identify any potential blockers or missing pieces you'll need before you get started. When thinking about the scope of your goals, ask yourself:\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cul\u003e\r\n\u003cli\u003eAre there people outside of this team who need to be informed or consulted to achieve this goal?\u003c/li\u003e\r\n\u003cli\u003eIf we achieve every KPI listed, will it result in the completion of the objective?\u003c/li\u003e\r\n\u003cli\u003eDoes the team need additional resources to complete the goal?\u003c/li\u003e\r\n\u003c/ul\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003eYou can also break down the scope of the goal by identifying what the group needs to do as a whole and what each individual needs to do.

Team OKRs should align with your company\u0026rsquo;s mission and values. When you're reviewing your OKRs, ask yourself how the OKR is contributing to the company mission.

Regardless of the software used, an intranet is the content management system (CMS) that provides people access to resources like:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eCompany announcements\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eLinks to internal web apps \u0026amp; cloud resources\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eCalendars\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003ePolicies\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eEmployee directories\u0026nbsp;\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eForms\u0026nbsp;\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://qatalog.com/blog/post/qatalog-vs-documentation-apps-gdrive-dropbox/\" rel=\"follow noopener\"\u003eProcedures\u003c/a\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eTypes of intranets\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eToday, you can group most intranet solutions into one of three groups:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"\u003e\u003cb\u003eTraditional intranet\u003c/b\u003e: A centralized portal-style intranet that provides CMS-like access to web pages, resources, and files.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"\u003e\u003cb\u003eSocial intranet\u003c/b\u003e: Social intranets add features like chatting, liking, and @ mentions to traditional intranets.

Users connect to a site using a web browser and click links on HTML web pages.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe key difference is while the Internet is open to anyone, an intranet is isolated to an individual organization. For example, you may only be able to connect to your company\u0026rsquo;s intranet via VPN, after authenticating using a cloud service provider, or when you\u0026rsquo;re in the office.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eWhat about extranets?\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eExtranets are intranets shared by multiple organizations.

Intuitively, this makes sense. If you have easy access to all the information and tools you need, you get more of the important stuff done.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUnfortunately, intranets often fall short of their potential, with \u003ca href=\"https://blog.enplug.com/7-surprising-internal-communications-stats\" rel=\"follow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eresearch suggesting\u003c/a\u003e only \u003cb\u003e13% of employees use their intranet daily\u003c/b\u003e and over \u003cb\u003e30% \u003c/b\u003e\u003cb\u003e\u003ci\u003enever \u003c/i\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003cb\u003euse it\u003c/b\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo, why is it that in practice the impact of intranets tends to be underwhelming?\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrom a user perspective, the low engagement is often caused by the difficulty of finding information and using the intranet or the simple fact the intranet is full of dated and irrelevant information. Intranets \u003cb\u003eoften suffer from stale, redundant, or hard-to-find data\u003c/b\u003e. Additionally, intranets often lack thoughtful user-experience design and easy-to-use integrations for the apps where teams do their real work (e.g. \u003ca href=\"https://qatalog.com/blog/post/qatalog-vs-project-management-asana-trello-jira/\" rel=\"follow noopener\"\u003eproject management\u003c/a\u003e software like Jira and CRMs like SalesForce).\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut why is it so common for intranets to get into this state? In a word: complexity.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBuilding and maintaining an intranet is both technically complex and resource-intensive. Beyond simply standing up the platform, overcoming customization, usability, and integration challenges is no small task. Often, outside consultants and developers are needed to devise and implement an intranet strategy. Then internal stakeholders need training and onboarding to begin using the platform.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEven when the initial provisioning and deployment of an intranet goes well, maintaining content over time often falls by the wayside. This is because maintaining an intranet platform becomes additional \u0026ldquo;work about work.\u0026rdquo; Stakeholders lose interest as they focus on the apps where real work gets done, the intranet content goes stale, and users look elsewhere for the information they need.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn turn, knowledge that should have been easily accessible on the company intranet becomes tribal knowledge.

For the entire organization, their forecasting model was based on a single spreadsheet maintained by one person in an office in Perth, the head office being in the USA. Every project manager in that organization then copied that master spreadsheet to their own computer to manage their project, uploading into a finance system once a month. The person in Perth regularly updated it of course, but when you looked under the hood, it was like arcane magic.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003eThat organization was using a hammer to clean their bathroom sink. Does it work? Sure! Is it appropriate? Absolutely not. But it worked to fulfil a need that could probably be found elsewhere, \u003ca href=\"https://medium.com/all-the-things/a-single-infinitely-customizable-app-for-everything-else-9abed7c5b5e7\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003eso we muddled through\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003e.

Go and take a look out of a window. See something that was built within the last 10 to 15 years? It was probably made using a spreadsheet to manage at least one part of the construction. \u0026ldquo;That's not so bad!\u0026rdquo; you cry. Well, I can see a nuclear power station and an airport if I squint from my window. I'd rather they didn't plan projects and create Gantt charts in a spreadsheet when constructing such vital buildings! (I can\u0026rsquo;t see a nuclear power station and I can only see planes from my window, but you get the point!)\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003ch2\u003eBut my spreadsheets are great!\u003c/h2\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003eLook, don't get me wrong.

A better comparison would be to compare a spreadsheet to a utility tool, which had knives, saws, screwdrivers, bottle openers and those things for getting stones out of horses feet.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003eBut if your builder turned up to start on your remodel and their entire toolbox contained just one tool\u0026mdash;a utility tool, you'd question whether they were the right person for the job, wouldn't you?\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003ch2\u003eA better alternative: new ways of working\u003c/h2\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003eThe next time you reach for a spreadsheet to start a new \u003ci\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003ething\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/i\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003e, pause for a moment and consider whether there might be a better, more suitable tool for the job at hand? Something that is designed to do the job you're about to do, to do it better, faster, more accurately and with fewer requirements for you to create arcane (or just plain) magic in the formula bar.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003eFor example, most organizations go through a period of \u003c/span\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://qatalog.com/blog/post/new-way-of-work/\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003egoal setting\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003e, either annually, or quarterly around this time of year.
