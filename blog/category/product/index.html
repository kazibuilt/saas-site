When a team member requests a new tool to use, it first goes to our security team to approve and identify what type of access is needed. After that has been approved, the requester needs to add the payment information and it goes to the finance team to approve and complete. Previously, all these steps would have been done in direct messages on Slack, and there would not have been the required steps for our certifications process. Now, the requester can see exactly in which stage the request is and what next steps still need to be done to complete the request.

We use Qatalog to manage all of our vendors, where we store key information about them, such as the renewal date, owners, cost, data risk, and more. At the end of the new vendor request Workflow (mentioned above), a new item is automatically created in the system, with much of the information already populated. It helps to eliminate a tedious manual task and ensures consistency of information.

The system understands the needs of any organization, no matter the industry. In less than a minute, customers can go from briefly describing their business to using their bespoke Work Hub, which centralizes all of their people, processes, and knowledge. \u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003e\u003cspan\u003eRadical simplification of the tool stack \u003c/span\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eWith Qatalog 2.0, companies no longer have to use a stack of generic project management tools, task managers, company wikis and document editors, which don't integrate with each other, and don\u0026rsquo;t reflect the nuances of how different organizations work. Qatalog replaces all these point solutions with an integrated made-to-measure platform. The customer simply tells Qatalog what kind of business it is, and it will create a single, centralized Work Hub in seconds, with all of the functionality they need. Customers can then make further changes to precisely configure the platform exactly as they want. \u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eThis allows for a radical simplification of the tool stack. Qatalog\u0026rsquo;s Work Hub acts as the unifying software layer across an entire organization, replacing a range of applications, and integrating with specialized tools for specific use cases, such as Figma for design, GitHub for code, or Salesforce for commercial use-cases. \u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003e\u003cspan\u003eQatalogAI \u003c/span\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eQatalogAI is currently in beta, but it already demonstrates a clear understanding of the likely requirements for each customer\u0026rsquo;s Qatalog Work Hub, as well as the relationships, permissions, features and data models that will be needed. The feat is possible because of the foundational architecture of Qatalog\u0026rsquo;s product infrastructure, which was built to catalog business items, connect tools, and streamline collaboration at scale. This infrastructure is what allows the AI to generate actionable designs that can be instantly turned into powerful software. Over the next 12 months, Qatalog plans to build its AI into features across its platform to help automate menial tasks, make smart suggestions, and much more. \u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003e\u003cspan\u003eAn Intelligent Work Hub \u003c/span\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eAt its core, Qatalog\u0026rsquo;s Work Hub is a set of tools to manage people, processes and knowledge in a centralized platform that\u0026rsquo;s seamlessly connected. With Qatalog 2.0, these tools can be completely customized and reconfigured to create custom software to manage businesses of any industry, size, or structure. If a company uses specific terminology to reflect a distinct operating model or culture, this is also mirrored. This allows Qatalog to reproduce the core business operations of any company and make them digitally native. \u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eFor instance, a global marketing agency might want to manage its Clients, Campaigns, Consultants and Offices; a recruitment firm might want to manage its Recruiters, Roles, Clients, and Candidates; while a tech company might want to manage its Customers, Products, Projects, and People. In each case, bespoke software \u0026lsquo;Modules\u0026rsquo; are configured to fit the intended use case, with seamless relationships between them. \u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eDespite the high level of customizability, the platform remains highly structured and scalable. Once a customer has agreed on the design for their Qatalog Work Hub, the structure is locked in place for the rest of the team or company, but can be configured by accounts with relevant permissions. This ensures consistency as the company grows, with minimal oversight required. \u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003e\u003cspan\u003eTariq Rauf, founder and CEO of Qatalog, said: \u003c/span\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003e\u0026ldquo;This isn\u0026rsquo;t just about Qatalog 2.0, we are at the forefront of a new era of software where machines understand us, adapt to us, and work for us.

Not only is it visually appealing, but we\u0026rsquo;ve also made it much easier to get started on Qatalog with guided setups. So, if you haven\u0026rsquo;t seen our smooth, easy-on-the-eye design \u0026mdash; we\u0026rsquo;ve often been called the only GenZ/Millennial-friendly work solution out there \u0026mdash; you\u0026rsquo;re missing out.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003ch3\u003eBug reporting and bug squashing\u003c/h3\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003eHowever, as with all larger-scale updates to software, bugs will inevitably crawl between the code. So before we let our customers share in our rapture for how much easier work gets with every new release across our Work Hub, we stress test everything internally, in a process dubbed dogfooding. It\u0026rsquo;s become a sort of competition between us \u0026ndash; who can find the most, the hardest to uncover, or the most critical to usability. And we wouldn\u0026rsquo;t have a chance of getting any of this done without \u003ca href=\"https://qatalog.com/workflows/\" rel=\"follow\"\u003eQatalog\u0026rsquo;s very own Workflow feature\u003c/a\u003e.

There are text fields for the description of actual behavior vs. expected behavior, drop downs for browser and hardware info, and additional upload fields for images or videos. Once the Workflow is completed, we immediately receive a notification in our #bugs Slack channel which allows for further discussion and additional visibility. Most importantly, the Workflow automatically creates a ticket for the relevant engineer using all the entered data. In short, the completion of one process in a Qatalog Workflow triggers the automatic completion of two other steps linked to our engineering tech stack, which most of the team don\u0026rsquo;t have access to. This saves approximately 10 minutes of work per bug for an engineer but, above all, it puts a structured, consistent and scalable process in place that ensures we can priortize and trace bugs and keep shipping improvements to our customers\u0026hellip;and to our Chief of staff. \u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003ch3\u003eAutomating standard operational procedures\u0026nbsp;\u003c/h3\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003eThat\u0026rsquo;s just one example of how \u003ca href=\"https://qatalog.com/workflows/\" rel=\"follow\"\u003eQatalog uses Workflows internally to save everybody time\u003c/a\u003e while creating a higher-quality outcome. So if you don\u0026rsquo;t have bugs to worry about, how else can Workflows help your business? In a nutshell, Workflows let you \u003ca href=\"https://qatalog.com/use-case/process-management/\" rel=\"follow\"\u003eautomate standard operational procedures\u003c/a\u003e. They transform repeat tasks into a structured and simplified sequence, making it easy for crucial steps to be followed correctly, even by people unfamiliar with the process or completing it for the first time. The completion of one task triggers or even automates the start of another and the user only has to fill in the parts that are unique to the event, saving hours a week.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003eInternally, we rely on Workflows across people operations for quick weekly processes such as payroll updates, work with external accountants, or multilayered, monthly processes like \u003ca href=\"https://qatalog.com/templates/hiring-process-steps/\" rel=\"follow\"\u003ehiring\u003c/a\u003e, \u003ca href=\"https://qatalog.com/blog/post/create-a-seamless-onboarding-experience/\" rel=\"follow\"\u003eonboarding\u003c/a\u003e, or colleague feedback, to \u003ca href=\"https://qatalog.com/blog/post/raise-your-work-standards/\" rel=\"follow\"\u003eensure consistency in execution every time\u003c/a\u003e.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003eOur finance team uses Workflows to gather all requests to \u003ca href=\"https://qatalog.com/blog/post/workflow-collaboration-external-partners/\" rel=\"follow\"\u003ework with external consultants\u003c/a\u003e, contractors, and companies in one place. Our sales team documents their daily standups or post-sales call actions using Workflows. Our customers have raved about their newfound ability to operationalize daily routines, cover critical Project steps, onboard clients, log requests to ops teams, or even create \u003ca href=\"https://qatalog.com/use-case/knowledge-management/\" rel=\"follow\"\u003einternal resource centers\u003c/a\u003e like intern reading assignments. No matter the team, there is a clear use case for setting up a Workflow and getting time back that would otherwise have been wasted searching through your tool stack or duplicating work.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003eIf you\u0026rsquo;re new to the world of process automation the good news is that you don\u0026rsquo;t have to start from scratch. Our Workflows are now available to Qatalog users in the form of templates, such as daily stand-ups, new joiner onboarding, or hiring process templates.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://cdn.buttercms.com/f2bNjIKFRp2NSgCFMWox\" alt=\"July-blog-post-workflows (1).png\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" /\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003eAnd this most recent version of Qatalog brought further superpowers to Workflows.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003eCoordinated Workflows let you create things like team or project-specific processes that simplify alignment. Externally shared Workflows let you collaborate with teams outside your org. No more back and forth, \u003ca href=\"https://qatalog.com/blog/post/client-collaboration-survey/\" rel=\"follow\"\u003eno more squinting at email threads\u003c/a\u003e for information, just hours of time saved. And nested Workflows merge multiple processes into one, which makes complex tasks like the onboarding of a new employee manageable using only one primary Workflow. You can read more about how you can turn weeks of onboarding into an afternoon \u003ca href=\"https://qatalog.com/blog/post/create-a-seamless-onboarding-experience/\" rel=\"follow\"\u003ehere\u003c/a\u003e.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003eIf you\u0026rsquo;re starting to sense a pattern, it\u0026rsquo;s because there is one \u0026ndash; our Workflows give time back to people so they can spend it on the things that matter, rather than wasting it on mundane, repetitive work.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003eAnd it doesn\u0026rsquo;t stop there. Our engineers have also added a multitude of new steps and outputs to improve functionality. Within a Workflow, it's now possible to create Asana or ClickUp tasks, Jira or Linear issues, Trello cards, or even automate the creation of new Dropbox or Google Drive folders and save files within them. In turn, these outputs can also be used to trigger further steps. As demonstrated with our bug reporting Workflow \u0026ndash; the Shortcut ticket that is rendered after the Workflow is completed also generates and sends a Slack message to the Qatalog bugs channel. Qatalog not only integrates seamlessly with other work tools but acts as a \u003ca href=\"https://qatalog.com/blog/post/what-is-a-work-hub/\" rel=\"follow\"\u003ecoordination layer\u003c/a\u003e between them.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003eLong story short, with Qatalog you don\u0026rsquo;t need to be an engineer to set up automated company processes. \u003ca href=\"https://qatalog.com/signup/\" rel=\"follow\"\u003eStart here!\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e","summary":"You don’t need to be an engineer to create standardized company processes.

Each day they would go and meet with various people from across the business, who had very rarely spent much time thinking about what they should say.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003eThen there\u0026rsquo;s the huge checklist of other critical tasks that HR teams and hiring managers have to do before someone even starts, all of which can be unbelievably time-consuming. This includes things like payroll, contracts, tech equipment, compliance, and more.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003eNow, in the era of remote work, the stakes are higher. Companies need to be much more intentional to get the employee experience right, as they can no longer rely on the office as a failsafe. You can\u0026rsquo;t simply turn to a colleague and ask them to quickly explain something. Nor can you take a quick tour of the office and introduce yourself to various teams or departments and have a quick chat, to get a sense of who does what. On top of that, you now have the logistical challenges of getting all of the equipment they need to work from home effectively.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003eFor companies that are growing quickly and hiring constantly, this can quickly become a problem if it\u0026rsquo;s not managed correctly, and crucial things can be missed. Online onboarding tools and standalone workflow software are sometimes touted as potential solutions, but they come at steep additional costs and sit separately from the rest of a company\u0026rsquo;s work and processes.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003eSince joining Qatalog almost two years ago, I\u0026rsquo;ve used our own \u003ca href=\"https://qatalog.com/workflows/\" rel=\"follow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eWorkflows\u003c/a\u003e feature to onboard new joiners, which allows you to build customized, repeatable processes, and automates large parts of them too. This has already saved me hundreds of hours and ensures that nothing falls through the cracks. And for the new joiner, what used to take them a couple of weeks is all sorted in an afternoon, meaning they can get started much faster.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://cdn.buttercms.com/G8as8dTfiGsMqysrKvxQ\" alt=\"undefined\" width=\"601\" height=\"399\" style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" /\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003eHere are my five tips for successful onboarding using Qatalog:\u0026nbsp;\u003cb\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003ch3\u003e1. Provide access to vital tools from day-one\u003c/h3\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003eThere\u0026rsquo;s nothing worse than starting a new role but being unable to access crucial information because you don\u0026rsquo;t have a log-in and then having to chase five different people to give you access. To make sure everyone can hit the ground running, we created a Workflow with steps that include the invite links from each of the core tools each team needs. Whenever we have a new joiner, one of the admins selects the relevant Workflow, and goes through the steps to invite them to each of the tools. It takes about fifteen minutes in total, and it means they are set up with everything they need from day one.\u0026nbsp;\u003cb\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003ch3\u003e2. Never forget security and compliance training again\u003c/h3\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003eIt\u0026rsquo;s no one's idea of fun, but making sure new joiners are quickly made aware of security procedures and policies is critical. We\u0026rsquo;ve made this part of our onboarding Workflow, meaning all new joiners will automatically be assigned relevant training to complete, such as GDPR rules and data security. Because it forms part of our standard onboarding Workflow, it\u0026rsquo;s literally impossible for us to forget it.\u0026nbsp;\u003cb\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://cdn.buttercms.com/VlStRKMwR166RgWQLhtl\" alt=\"Workflows.png\" width=\"601\" height=\"398\" style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" /\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003ch3\u003e3. Automate WFH equipment requests\u003c/h3\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003eAs a remote-first company, we provide a budget for all new employees to improve their work-from-home setup. We still wanted to manage the process centrally, but we knew it had the potential to be quite time-consuming for all involved. To streamline it, we added a step to our standard onboarding Workflow that allows new joiners to submit links (e.g from Amazon) for the pieces of equipment they want, along with any notes or explanations. We then review it and, once it\u0026rsquo;s been approved, they get a notification to say that it's on its way. Job done.\u0026nbsp;\u003cb\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003ch3\u003e4. Get up to speed in record time\u003c/h3\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003eThere\u0026rsquo;s often a lot to take in whenever you start a new job with a barrage of information in the form of presentations and webinars. Qatalog allows everyone to do this on their own schedule. Our onboarding Workflow points everyone to our \u0026lsquo;Company\u0026rsquo; section, which every Qatalog user will have. As the name suggests, the Company section is where you can store key information about your company; things like values or tenets, benefits, and policies, useful articles, as well as information you might need day-to-day, like the WiFi password for the office.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003eAll of this is clearly important, but it can still feel detached from the actual work that people do. What is particularly unique about Qatalog is that it allows every user to seamlessly navigate around the company, looking at different teams and their members, projects, tasks, processes, and key resources. This quickly gives people context on who is who, what they have been working on, why certain decisions have been made, and what objectives everyone is working towards.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003eIn many ways, it\u0026rsquo;s like being able to walk around the office and have a chat with everyone while having a rummage through their latest work (unless it\u0026rsquo;s marked as private, of course). Except that with Qatalog, it\u0026rsquo;s on demand whenever you need it, and it\u0026rsquo;s constantly being updated automatically.\u0026nbsp;\u003cb\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://cdn.buttercms.com/Poxg0RuyRO2VDONWWczU\" alt=\"undefined\" width=\"603\" height=\"400\" style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" /\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003ch3\u003e5. Make the fun stuff easy\u003c/h3\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003eIt\u0026rsquo;s important to remember the little things that ensure people get a warm welcome. But there\u0026rsquo;s always a danger this gets forgotten about when work gets busy. To get to know everyone a little better, we play a game of \u0026lsquo;two truths and one lie\u0026rsquo; with every new joiner on our all-company Zoom calls. To make sure we don\u0026rsquo;t forget (yes you guessed it), we include a step in everyone\u0026rsquo;s onboarding Workflow, where we ask them to submit the three answers. Other things might be getting people to introduce themselves on Slack (the Workflow points them to the right channel), or submitting a photo to create our branded illustrations (again via the Workflow). Essentially, once you\u0026rsquo;ve built a process as a Workflow, you can repeat it time and time again without having to think twice, and you can keep tweaking and improving as you go.

Not only does it stop you from getting work done, it also makes it much harder for people to get context on what\u0026rsquo;s going on across their organization.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eQatalog\u0026rsquo;s recently upgraded Workplace Search feature is designed to help solve this problem, making it quick and simple to find the files and documents that you want, no matter where they\u0026rsquo;re stored. Unified search has become particularly important for remote and distributed companies, helping to avoid constant interruptions to ask where files are, something which is critical for teams working across time zones who can\u0026rsquo;t afford to wait until their colleagues start work six hours later.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe end result is that cross-functional work becomes more visible and accessible, while also ensuring that everyone can actually focus on getting their work done.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eQatalog makes all this possible by integrating with a host of applications, such as Google Drive, Asana, Microsoft Office, Gmail, Outlook, and connecting relevant work, in Qatalog, across teams. Despite all these integrations, which create thousands more potential matches, your search will still return relevant results every time, and at lightning speed.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo, how on earth does it work? I spoke to the Engineering team, to find out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003e\u003cb\u003eHow do you make sure people get relevant search results, even with all of these integrations?\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLarge organizations often suffer from this problem, because they are working across lots of tools, creating tens of thousands of documents, and the keyword density for certain terms quickly becomes too high to yield useful results.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOur fundamental advantage is that we understand the structure of an organization and how each person relates to their work because that\u0026rsquo;s inherent to the way Qatalog works. For example, Qatalog knows\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003e what team someone is in\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003e, what Projects they are working on, and who they are collaborating with regularly. All of this data forms our \u0026lsquo;Workgraph\u0026rsquo;, which allows us to make sure the results are as relevant as they can be.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003e\u003cb\u003eWhy doesn\u0026rsquo;t all of this information slow it down? How is it still so fast?\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe speed of search can become a potential problem when you have so much information. The short answer is that we use a cluster of virtual machines and services dedicated to search only, which improve speed and scalability. The search cluster reads data from Qatalog, which is in tabular form and indexes it in \u0026lsquo;document\u0026rsquo; form. This makes it much easier to calculate relevancy. It also means when there's a high load in the system, we instantly increase the number of servers, which ensures it\u0026rsquo;s always super fast. And when this is combined with data from any API integration, it goes through our processing algorithm where we calculate the relevancy and reorder it again, before the results are shown to the customer. This all happens in about one second!\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003e\u003cb\u003eAnd why is this different from other search tool providers in the market?\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMost search-only providers don\u0026rsquo;t have the context that we have from Qatalog users\u0026rsquo; Workgraph, meaning it\u0026rsquo;s \u003ca href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/search-web-email-google-streaming-online-shopping-broken-2022-4\" rel=\"follow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"\u003esignificantly harder for them to know what\u0026rsquo;s relevant\u003c/a\u003e. Often they will build on top of API search integrations for all the different tools and spit out results using the limited information they have. This typically results in a much slower search experience, with very little guarantee of getting useful results.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003e\u003cb\u003eWhat else have you done to make it easier to find things quickly?\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe\u0026rsquo;ve added simple features like filtering to allow customers to drill down and get more granular results. For example, you can filter by person, by integration, or by date. So if you know a particular person shared a document with you, but you don\u0026rsquo;t know where or when you can narrow it down much faster. In addition, you can also search by the \u0026lsquo;type of work\u0026rsquo;. So, if you know something was shared in a Post on Qatalog, you can filter by \u0026lsquo;Posts\u0026rsquo; and \u0026lsquo;Person\u0026rsquo;.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003e\u003cb\u003eAre there systems in place to ensure security and privacy?\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll of Qatalog has been designed with \u003ca href=\"https://qatalog.com/for/enterprise/\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003esecurity and privacy in mind\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003e.\u0026nbsp; The crucial thing to mention with Search is that we don\u0026rsquo;t index data from the integrations, so we don\u0026rsquo;t have customer data from all those different tools sitting on our server. This means you also don\u0026rsquo;t have to worry about permissions and ownership either, because we just use permissions from the \u003c/span\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://auth0.com/docs/secure/tokens/access-tokens\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003eAPI tokens.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003e Instead, we enhance the results from the API with our own relevancy score.

Kumaran left to join Qatalog about 6 months before me, and told me all about it, before introducing me to Tariq. I was sold on the vision too, and I knew there was an opportunity to build something very meaningful.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003ch3\u003e\u003cb\u003eWhat is the role of a Product Manager or Director, and what does that look like day to day for the two of you?\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eKV: \u003c/b\u003eUltimately it\u0026rsquo;s about making sure you are solving a customer problem. Our role is to focus on how to keep improving a product in line with what customers want, and coordinating that process with lots of different teams internally. That means lots of usability research and testing, looking at designs, and then getting it built. Then it starts again. It\u0026rsquo;s a constant flywheel of research and continuous improvement.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eVK: \u003c/b\u003eThere\u0026rsquo;s lots of prioritization involved too. We are constantly evaluating what to focus on, whether that\u0026rsquo;s launching new features, or fixing any bugs. We have to make judgment calls on what works and what doesn\u0026rsquo;t, and live with the scar tissue. In our retrospectives, when we look back and assess what we\u0026rsquo;ve done, we have to take ownership of our decisions too, whether they result in success or failure.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003ch3\u003e\u003cb\u003eEveryone at Qatalog uses it every day. Has it made your job as Product Directors easier?\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eKV: \u003c/b\u003eIt might sound ridiculous, but it\u0026rsquo;s hard to imagine working without Qatalog now. There are lots of useful features, but the visibility and access to stored knowledge across different teams and projects is probably the biggest reason for that. At Amazon it was chaos, even with their documentation culture, because everyone did things in different ways and, just because something was documented doesn\u0026rsquo;t mean you could find it. That almost never happens now.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003ch3\u003e\u003cb\u003eWhy is visibility and access to knowledge so important?\u0026nbsp;\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eVK: \u003c/b\u003eWe work with people from design, engineering, and marketing everyday. Visibility of what\u0026rsquo;s going on across an organization means you can ensure early collaboration and bring in the right stakeholders. It was common for different teams within Amazon to be working on projects tackling very similar problems, but we had no idea, meaning there was huge duplication of effort. If you can easily find the right people to talk to early in the process, you can massively reduce your development time.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003eQatalog also means you end up building a rich database of projects that have been tried before. For a Product Manager, that is a goldmine. We can go and look at what was done previously and review all the learnings, because it\u0026rsquo;s documented, clearly structured, and accessible. This allows us to make smarter and more informed decisions about new projects, and avoid making the same mistakes.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eKV: \u003c/b\u003eI agree - the documentation aspect of Qatalog has been great. Even if it\u0026rsquo;s things we have worked on ourselves, or ideas we ended up not progressing with, we refer back to why certain decisions were taken, using Threads. This was impossible at Amazon, as everyone had a different source of truth. Sometimes we\u0026rsquo;d all be using the same document, but version control was a nightmare. Everyone was always pinging each other to ask for the latest versions.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003ch3\u003e\u003cb\u003eBut now you feel like you\u0026rsquo;ve got a single source of truth with Qatalog?\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eKV: \u003c/b\u003eOne hundred percent! Often we will be working on big feature launches that take a long time and are fairly complex, with lots of resources and artifacts throughout its lifecycle - and we use Qatalog \u003ca href=\"https://qatalog.com/projects/\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003eProjects\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003e to centralize these resources. We use Pages to conceptualize the problem and solution, Timelines to break down project phases and expected completion dates, Tasks to assign work across people, Threads to have async discussions, and \u003c/span\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://qatalog.com/goals/\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003eGoals\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003e to assess how successful it's been post launch.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003eIt also provides a much better space for collaboration between teams, that would otherwise be done through email or Slack, meaning everyone knows where things are up to. Product Managers can often spend their life updating people, so this is invaluable.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003ch3\u003e\u003cb\u003eWhat about integrations? Has that been useful?\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eVK: \u003c/b\u003eVery much so, for different reasons. One obvious example is the \u003ca href=\"https://qatalog.com/search/\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003eSearch\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003e feature. Being able to search for files across all the different tools we use saves everyone a \u003c/span\u003e\u003ci\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003elot\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/i\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003e of time. But for our role specifically, Qatalog also integrates with things like GitHub and having that built into our projects makes it really easy for me to keep track of what\u0026rsquo;s moving and what\u0026rsquo;s stalled.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003ch3\u003e\u003cb\u003eTo what extent is this more important for remote and distributed teams?\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eVK: \u003c/b\u003eOur engineering and design teams are fully distributed working across four continents, but our Product Management team is still pretty lean. Ordinarily this would be quite difficult, because you\u0026rsquo;d need to keep everyone updated, even if they\u0026rsquo;re working a very different schedule to you. But with Qatalog, everyone is able to bring themselves up to speed in their own time, because everything is accessible and decision making processes are visible. As Product Directors, this means we have more time to get things done, but it also means our team has more flexibility in terms of when they work, which they value enormously.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003ch3\u003e\u003cb\u003eAnd finally, what new features are you most excited about?\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eVK: \u003c/b\u003eAutomation of actions. Qatalog will start to automatically assign actions to people following certain triggers. For example, if you move from one team to another, it will automatically assign certain \u003ca href=\"https://qatalog.com/workflows/\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003eWorkflows\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003e.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eKV: \u003c/b\u003eTasks is going to get a big upgrade where we can start to attach different groups of tasks to the different phases of large projects. That will make it much easier to plan large and complex projects, for those who need to.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e","summary":"Product Directors, Varun and Kumaran, explain what Product Management is all about and how Qatalog can help people in their role.","seo_title":"Making the Product Management role easier | Qatalog","meta_description":"What do Project Managers do?

There are three pillars to recruiting, and all three are extremely biased against black people, and black women in particular. One is organic, the second is referrals, and the third is sourcing. We are trying to tackle all three of these, using a human first approach.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eWhy did you decide to start Hire Black Now? Was it something you always wanted to do?\u0026nbsp;\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003eHire Black just started. I was a furloughed tech recruiter at the beginning of the pandemic and at the same time the George Floyd protests were happening. I wanted to advocate for the black community in my own way. On Juneteenth I set out to help 19 black women with their resumes, as lots of people were struggling to find work. In the end, more than 500 women got in touch, and I realized there was an opportunity to do something much bigger. From there it just took off.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eHow is Hire Black different from a normal recruitment agency?\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003eWe are not a recruitment agency. We consider ourselves to be super connectors, helping people to build connections, predominantly through our events and summits. The women we work with are highly capable and extremely skilled, they just don\u0026rsquo;t have the access or the network. Our job is to help expand people\u0026rsquo;s network of recruiters and hiring managers in our community.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003eThese connections allow people to challenge what \u0026lsquo;qualified\u0026rsquo; means. In a fifteen minute conversation with a recruiter or a hiring manager, they might discover that someone actually is qualified for a certain role, even if they didn\u0026rsquo;t go to a certain school, or take a certain career path. We help to facilitate those connections.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eWhat kind of feedback do you get from the people you work with?\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003eLots of people are just amazed at the opportunities they have been able to land. Especially when they realize how underpaid they have been before. Some people have doubled their salaries and, while this makes me excited, it should never have happened in the first place, and it shows how far we still have to go.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eWhat\u0026rsquo;s next for Hire Black Now?\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003eRight now we have about 15,000 people as part of our network, and we want to keep growing that over time. We have some exciting partnerships that we are in the process of launching, as well as some large career expos coming up. One day I would love to fill a whole stadium with programming and networking opportunities, or create a festival to empower people with their careers. But I want these to feel authentic where black people can be themselves.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eHow has the shift to remote work impacted the work you do?\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003eI am a big believer in remote work generally, but it also supports diversity and inclusion. Some of the people we work with are looking after several generations of family members in their own home. With remote work, they can juggle these familial responsibilities in addition to their own work. It also means they aren\u0026rsquo;t exposed to the microaggressions they might experience when relocating to a new city that\u0026rsquo;s not as diverse, or in an office, which unfortunately are still far too common.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eWhat made you start using Qatalog?\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003e\u003c/b\u003eI first found Qatalog on Instagram, where it was described as a Work Hub that connected to all the other things we used, like Slack, Asana and Google Docs. Our team was growing quickly and we were constantly onboarding new people, which means we needed some structure to help make information accessible and streamline our processes. As soon as I saw that Instagram ad, I thought, \u0026lsquo;this is what we need\u0026rsquo;.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eHow do you use Qatalog day-to-day?\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003eWe use it for all sorts of things.

That includes things like marketing campaign metrics, such as click through rates, open rates, newsletter subscriber counts.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003eWe also use it to document all of our standard operating procedures (SOPs). For example, if you were to look at our Content Team on Qatalog, they have resources that outline how we post a job ad at Hire Black. It has made key information much easier to find, and means people can get on with doing their job.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003eIt\u0026rsquo;s also proven really useful for onboarding our sponsors when we do our big events. Each sponsor has their own dedicated space with all the relevant information, meaning they have context on what to expect, and we can make sure they fill out all the forms we need.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eWhat are some of the most useful features?\u0026nbsp;\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003eI really love the \u003ca href=\"https://qatalog.com/workflows/\" rel=\"follow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eWorkflows\u003c/a\u003e feature and how easy it makes everything. Otherwise there is so much that people have to do. But Workflows automates most of the manual work and has been a massive time saver for everyone.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003eThe Goals feature has also been a complete game changer. I love the fact that you can add comments to give more context, and the graph that shows your progress and whether you are on track. It\u0026rsquo;s probably the feature we all use, because every single one the team has a target that we are working towards. Now the whole team has visibility on it, which has given us a real sense of momentum.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e","summary":"Find out how Hire Black Now is shaking up the recruitment industry and using Qatalog to help it scale.","seo_title":"Hire Black Now is disrupting the recruitment industry | Qatalog","meta_description":"Find out how Hire Black Now is shaking up the recruitment industry and using Qatalog to help it scale.","featured_image_alt":"Hire Black Now customer story banner","url":"https://qatalog.com/blog/post/hire-black-now-interview-niani-tolbert","featured_image":"https://cdn.buttercms.com/NQiVML9qRd6oXrwQKPLm","author":{"bio":"Sam Ferris leads on all things communications and helps to tell the story of Qatalog and its customers.","slug":"sam-ferris","email":"sam.ferris@qatalog.com","title":"Communications Manager @ Qatalog","last_name":"Ferris","first_name":"Sam","facebook_url":"","linkedin_url":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/sam-ferris-83a115113/","instagram_url":"","pinterest_url":"","profile_image":"https://cdn.buttercms.com/SsARjvkrSVS3B6V0sUrA","twitter_handle":"@_Sam_Ferris"},"tags":[{"name":"success story","slug":"success-story"}],"categories":[{"name":"Product","slug":"product"}]},{"status":"published","created":"2022-02-24T10:32:06.551266Z","updated":"2023-02-13T15:18:15.273733Z","published":"2022-02-25T14:45:00Z","title":"Qatalog now let’s you see your Company’s Org Chart, all from one place","slug":"org-charts-all-from-one-place","body":"\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003eGetting context on the who and what across different teams and departments is an age-old struggle that becomes even more pronounced when your team is distributed across different time zones and geographies.
