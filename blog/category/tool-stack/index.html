It\u0026rsquo;s hard for your spreadsheets to evolve with fast growth. Of course, they\u0026rsquo;re important for data analysis. But when it comes to assigning tasks, coordinating projects, and organizing clients, for example, they\u0026rsquo;re not sufficiently flexible or adaptable and quickly become unwieldy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf your business already employs hundreds of people, you\u0026rsquo;ll be all-too familiar with these scalability limits. In large and complex environments, spreadsheets simply don\u0026rsquo;t work for certain tasks. One (usually untraceable) error can throw a whole sequence of important formulas out, which you\u0026rsquo;ll then need to remedy.

An incorrect formula might mean that these critical milestones get missed.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThese errors only get worse as spreadsheets become larger and more complicated and as more people contribute to them. The risk of having someone interfere with a spreadsheet when they don\u0026rsquo;t have adequate knowledge can be serious.

First, the sheer volume of features and customization options can be overwhelming, especially if you\u0026rsquo;re not familiar with them. You\u0026rsquo;ve got to get to grips with types, tables, views, databases, hierarchies, relationships, dashboards, and integrations.

In order to get the most out of these tools, users need to carefully plan out their data structure and ensure everyone will be entering information in a consistent and organized manner.

You\u0026rsquo;ll need to consider the structure of your organization and think about how best to configure the system to fit your requirements. Depending on the size and complexity of the company, this can take a while, and it can be very fiddly joining up databases and making sure everything is working as it should.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 dir=\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan\u003e2.

The first problem is that they\u0026rsquo;re still very generalized and typically fail to take account of the nuances of your business. For example, it\u0026rsquo;s easy to find templates for a marketing team or for project management. However, you\u0026rsquo;d be hard pressed to find templates for a marketing team in a fund management business or a project management template for a logistics firm, both of which will look very different to the generic templates.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan\u003eMost templates are also optimized for individuals and teams.

It\u0026rsquo;s also worth noting that while they are technically low-code or no-code tools, you\u0026rsquo;re likely to still need some basic coding skills or use complex formulas to get the best out of them. Again, this may require someone with a technical background. In many organizations, people like this may be in short supply or in very high-demand, which can slow down the process quite significantly.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 dir=\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan\u003e4.

As the study describes, \u0026ldquo;for most employees, there isn\u0026rsquo;t an obvious way to avoid ping-ponging between documents, websites, and apps \u0026mdash; it\u0026rsquo;s just how the work has to be done\u0026rdquo;. \u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eThis echoes the findings from \u003ca href=\"https://language.work/research/workgeist/\" rel=\"follow\"\u003eour own research with Cornell University\u003c/a\u003e. We found that employees are wasting an hour every day trying to find information hidden within apps, and 43% say they spend too much time switching between them.

It\u0026rsquo;s become a sort of competition between us \u0026ndash; who can find the most, the hardest to uncover, or the most critical to usability. And we wouldn\u0026rsquo;t have a chance of getting any of this done without \u003ca href=\"https://qatalog.com/workflows/\" rel=\"follow\"\u003eQatalog\u0026rsquo;s very own Workflow feature\u003c/a\u003e.

In short, the completion of one process in a Qatalog Workflow triggers the automatic completion of two other steps linked to our engineering tech stack, which most of the team don\u0026rsquo;t have access to. This saves approximately 10 minutes of work per bug for an engineer but, above all, it puts a structured, consistent and scalable process in place that ensures we can priortize and trace bugs and keep shipping improvements to our customers\u0026hellip;and to our Chief of staff. \u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003ch3\u003eAutomating standard operational procedures\u0026nbsp;\u003c/h3\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003eThat\u0026rsquo;s just one example of how \u003ca href=\"https://qatalog.com/workflows/\" rel=\"follow\"\u003eQatalog uses Workflows internally to save everybody time\u003c/a\u003e while creating a higher-quality outcome.

In a nutshell, Workflows let you \u003ca href=\"https://qatalog.com/use-case/process-management/\" rel=\"follow\"\u003eautomate standard operational procedures\u003c/a\u003e. They transform repeat tasks into a structured and simplified sequence, making it easy for crucial steps to be followed correctly, even by people unfamiliar with the process or completing it for the first time. The completion of one task triggers or even automates the start of another and the user only has to fill in the parts that are unique to the event, saving hours a week.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003eInternally, we rely on Workflows across people operations for quick weekly processes such as payroll updates, work with external accountants, or multilayered, monthly processes like \u003ca href=\"https://qatalog.com/templates/hiring-process-steps/\" rel=\"follow\"\u003ehiring\u003c/a\u003e, \u003ca href=\"https://qatalog.com/blog/post/create-a-seamless-onboarding-experience/\" rel=\"follow\"\u003eonboarding\u003c/a\u003e, or colleague feedback, to \u003ca href=\"https://qatalog.com/blog/post/raise-your-work-standards/\" rel=\"follow\"\u003eensure consistency in execution every time\u003c/a\u003e.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003eOur finance team uses Workflows to gather all requests to \u003ca href=\"https://qatalog.com/blog/post/workflow-collaboration-external-partners/\" rel=\"follow\"\u003ework with external consultants\u003c/a\u003e, contractors, and companies in one place.

Our engineers have also added a multitude of new steps and outputs to improve functionality. Within a Workflow, it's now possible to create Asana or ClickUp tasks, Jira or Linear issues, Trello cards, or even automate the creation of new Dropbox or Google Drive folders and save files within them.

Intranets \u003cb\u003eoften suffer from stale, redundant, or hard-to-find data\u003c/b\u003e. Additionally, intranets often lack thoughtful user-experience design and easy-to-use integrations for the apps where teams do their real work (e.g. \u003ca href=\"https://qatalog.com/blog/post/qatalog-vs-project-management-asana-trello-jira/\" rel=\"follow noopener\"\u003eproject management\u003c/a\u003e software like Jira and CRMs like SalesForce).\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut why is it so common for intranets to get into this state? In a word: complexity.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBuilding and maintaining an intranet is both technically complex and resource-intensive. Beyond simply standing up the platform, overcoming customization, usability, and integration challenges is no small task. Often, outside consultants and developers are needed to devise and implement an intranet strategy. Then internal stakeholders need training and onboarding to begin using the platform.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEven when the initial provisioning and deployment of an intranet goes well, maintaining content over time often falls by the wayside.
